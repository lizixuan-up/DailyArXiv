| **[Community Quality and Influence Maximization: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03095v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influence maximization in social networks plays a vital role in applications such as viral marketing, epidemiology, product recommendation, opinion mining, and counter-terrorism. A common approach identifies seed nodes by first detecting disjoint communities and subsequently selecting representative nodes from these communities. However, whether the quality of detected communities consistently affects the spread of influence under the Independent Cascade model remains unclear. This paper addresses this question by extending a previously proposed disjoint community detection method, termed $α$-Hierarchical Clustering, to the influence maximization problem under the Independent Cascade model. The proposed method is compared with an alternative approach that employs the same seed selection criteria but relies on communities of lower quality obtained through standard Hierarchical Clustering. The former is referred to as Hierarchical Clustering-based Influence Maximization, while the latter, which leverages higher-quality community structures to guide seed selection, is termed $α$-Hierarchical Clustering-based Influence Maximization. Extensive experiments are performed on multiple real-world datasets to assess the effectiveness of both methods. The results demonstrate that higher-quality community structures substantially improve information diffusion under the Independent Cascade model, particularly when the propagation probability is low. These findings underscore the critical importance of community quality in guiding effective seed selection for influence maximization in complex networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked Diffusion for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23021v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation (GR) with semantic IDs (SIDs) has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional recommendation approaches due to its performance gains, capitalization on semantic information provided through language model embeddings, and inference and storage efficiency. Existing GR with SIDs works frame the probability of a sequence of SIDs corresponding to a user's interaction history using autoregressive modeling. While this has led to impressive next item prediction performances in certain settings, these autoregressive GR with SIDs models suffer from expensive inference due to sequential token-wise decoding, potentially inefficient use of training data and bias towards learning short-context relationships among tokens. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in NLP, we propose to instead model and learn the probability of a user's sequence of SIDs using masked diffusion. Masked diffusion employs discrete masking noise to facilitate learning the sequence distribution, and models the probability of masked tokens as conditionally independent given the unmasked tokens, allowing for parallel decoding of the masked tokens. We demonstrate through thorough experiments that our proposed method consistently outperforms autoregressive modeling. This performance gap is especially pronounced in data-constrained settings and in terms of coarse-grained recall, consistent with our intuitions. Moreover, our approach allows the flexibility of predicting multiple SIDs in parallel during inference while maintaining superior performance to autoregressive modeling.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Personalized Image Generation for Recommendations Beyond Catalogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18477v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization is central to human-AI interaction, yet current diffusion-based image generation systems remain largely insensitive to user diversity. Existing attempts to address this often rely on costly paired preference data or introduce latency through Large Language Models. In this work, we introduce REBECA (REcommendations BEyond CAtalogs), a lightweight and scalable framework for personalized image generation that learns directly from implicit feedback signals such as likes, ratings, and clicks. Instead of fine-tuning the underlying diffusion model, REBECA employs a two-stage process: training a conditional diffusion model to sample user- and rating-specific image embeddings, which are subsequently decoded into images using a pretrained diffusion backbone. This approach enables efficient, fine-tuning-free personalization across large user bases. We rigorously evaluate REBECA on real-world datasets, proposing a novel statistical personalization verifier and a permutation-based hypothesis test to assess preference alignment. Our results demonstrate that REBECA consistently produces high-fidelity images tailored to individual tastes, outperforming baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards A Tri-View Diffusion Framework for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20122v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have recently gained significant interest for their exceptional potential in recommendation tasks. This stems primarily from their prominent capability in distilling, modeling, and generating comprehensive user preferences. However, previous work fails to examine DMs in recommendation tasks through a rigorous lens. In this paper, we first experimentally investigate the completeness of recommender models from a thermodynamic view. We reveal that existing DM-based recommender models operate by maximizing the energy, while classic recommender models operate by reducing the entropy. Based on this finding, we propose a minimalistic diffusion framework that incorporates both factors via the maximization of Helmholtz free energy. Meanwhile, to foster the optimization, our reverse process is armed with a well-designed denoiser to maintain the inherent anisotropy, which measures the user-item cross-correlation in the context of bipartite graphs. Finally, we adopt an Acceptance-Rejection Gumbel Sampling Process (AR-GSP) to prioritize the far-outnumbered unobserved interactions for model robustness. AR-GSP integrates an acceptance-rejection sampling to ensure high-quality hard negative samples for general recommendation tasks, and a timestep-dependent Gumbel Softmax to handle an adaptive sampling strategy for diffusion models. Theoretical analyses and extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework has distinct superiority over baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures, accepted by KDD2026 (First Cycle)</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Item-Level Dynamic Variability with Residual Diffusion for Bundle Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03280v4)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing solutions for bundle recommendation (BR) have achieved remarkable effectiveness for predicting the user's preference for prebuilt bundles. However, bundle-item (B-I) affiliation will vary dynamically in real scenarios. For example, a bundle themed as 'casual outfit' may add 'hat' or remove 'watch' due to factors such as seasonal variations, changes in user preferences or inventory adjustments. Our empirical study demonstrates that the performance of mainstream BR models may fluctuate or decline under item-level variability. This paper makes the first attempt to address the above problem and proposes a novel Residual Diffusion for Bundle Recommendation(RDiffBR)asamodel-agnostic generative framework which can assist a BR model in adapting this scenario. During the initial training of the BR model, RDiffBR employs a residual diffusion model to process the item-level bundle embeddings which are generated by the BR model to represent bundle theme via a forward-reverse process. In the inference stage, RDiffBR reverses item-level bundle embeddings obtained by the well-trained bundle model under B-I variability scenarios to generate the effective item level bundle embeddings. In particular, the residual connection in our residual approximator significantly enhances BR models' ability to generate high-quality item-level bundle embeddings. Experiments on six BR models and four public datasets from different domains show that RDiffBR improves the performance of Recall and NDCG of backbone BR models by up to 23%, while only increases training time about 4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version for AAAI'26</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Diffusion Models for Time Series and Spatio-Temporal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18886v4)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been widely used in time series and spatio-temporal data, enhancing generative, inferential, and downstream capabilities. These models are applied across diverse fields such as healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and traffic. By separating applications for time series and spatio-temporal data, we offer a structured perspective on model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. This study aims to provide a solid foundation for researchers and practitioners, inspiring future innovations that tackle traditional challenges and foster novel solutions in diffusion model-based data mining tasks and applications.

| **[When and What to Recommend: Joint Modeling of Timing and Content for Active Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18717v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation models user preferences to predict the next target item. Most existing work is passive, where the system responds only when users open the application, missing chances after closure. We investigate active recommendation, which predicts the next interaction time and actively delivers items. Two challenges: accurately estimating the Time of Interest (ToI) and generating Item of Interest (IoI) conditioned on the predicted ToI. We propose PASRec, a diffusion-based framework that aligns ToI and IoI via a joint objective. Experiments on five benchmarks show superiority over eight state-of-the-art baselines under leave-one-out and temporal splits.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Incentivized Network Dynamics in Digital Job Recruitment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09698v3)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recruiting passive candidates, i.e., individuals not actively seeking jobs but open to compelling opportunities, remains one of the hardest challenges in digital recruitment. Motivated by a real collaboration with an industry partner, we introduce the Independent Halting Cascade (IHC) model: a simple but rich agent-based framework that couples network diffusion with the possibility of halting through job applications. Agents can either recommend vacancies to peers or apply themselves, and incentives increase the likelihood of recommendation, mobilizing otherwise passive candidates. The IHC bridges research on social network diffusion, coordinated task completion, and labor economics by modeling heterogeneous skills, job specificities, and network structures, including homophily. We derive analytical boundaries that characterize diffusion and failure regimes, and we show, through simulations, that the IHC reproduces the empirical chain-length distributions of Travers and Milgram, and of Dodds, with only coarse calibration. Across synthetic (ER, BA, homophilic) and real networks (SMS, e-mail, Twitter), the IHC achieves comparable or higher success rates than direct-recommendation baselines, while requiring fewer applicants. Our findings suggest that the IHC captures core mechanisms of coordinated task completion, offering both a theoretical contribution and a practical foundation for recruitment systems designed to reach and engage passive candidates.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages (16 main, 6 appendix), 10 figures (8 main, 2 appendix)</p></details> |
| **[MindRec: A Diffusion-driven Coarse-to-Fine Paradigm for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12597v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language model-based recommendation systems often represent items as text or semantic IDs and generate recommendations in an auto-regressive manner. However, due to the left-to-right greedy decoding strategy and the unidirectional logical flow, such methods often fail to produce globally optimal recommendations. In contrast, human reasoning does not follow a rigid left-to-right sequence. Instead, it often begins with keywords or intuitive insights, which are then refined and expanded. Inspired by this fact, we propose MindRec, a diffusion-driven coarse-to-fine generative paradigm that emulates human thought processes. Built upon a diffusion language model, MindRec departs from auto-regressive generation by leveraging a masked diffusion process to reconstruct items in a flexible, non-sequential manner. Particularly, our method first generates key tokens that reflect user preferences, and then expands them into the complete item, enabling adaptive and human-like generation. To further emulate the structured nature of human decision-making, we organize items into a hierarchical category tree. This structure guides the model to first produce the coarse-grained category and then progressively refine its selection through finer-grained subcategories before generating the specific item. To mitigate the local optimum problem inherent in greedy decoding, we design a novel beam search algorithm, Diffusion Beam Search, tailored for our mind-inspired generation paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that MindRec yields a 9.5\% average improvement in top-1 accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential to enhance recommendation performance. The implementation is available via https://github.com/Mr-Peach0301/MindRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous-time Discrete-space Diffusion Model for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12114v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of information explosion, Recommender Systems (RS) are essential for alleviating information overload and providing personalized user experiences. Recent advances in diffusion-based generative recommenders have shown promise in capturing the dynamic nature of user preferences. These approaches explore a broader range of user interests by progressively perturbing the distribution of user-item interactions and recovering potential preferences from noise, enabling nuanced behavioral understanding. However, existing diffusion-based approaches predominantly operate in continuous space through encoded graph-based historical interactions, which may compromise potential information loss and suffer from computational inefficiency. As such, we propose CDRec, a novel Continuous-time Discrete-space Diffusion Recommendation framework, which models user behavior patterns through discrete diffusion on historical interactions over continuous time. The discrete diffusion algorithm operates via discrete element operations (e.g., masking) while incorporating domain knowledge through transition matrices, producing more meaningful diffusion trajectories. Furthermore, the continuous-time formulation enables flexible adaptive sampling. To better adapt discrete diffusion models to recommendations, CDRec introduces: (1) a novel popularity-aware noise schedule that generates semantically meaningful diffusion trajectories, and (2) an efficient training framework combining consistency parameterization for fast sampling and a contrastive learning objective guided by multi-hop collaborative signals for personalized recommendation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate CDRec's superior performance in both recommendation accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WSDM 2026</p></details> |
| **[Fine-Tuning Diffusion-Based Recommender Systems via Reinforcement Learning with Reward Function Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06937v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for recommender systems, offering state-of-the-art performance by modeling the generative process of user-item interactions. However, training such models from scratch is both computationally expensive and yields diminishing returns once convergence is reached. To remedy these challenges, we propose ReFiT, a new framework that integrates Reinforcement learning (RL)-based Fine-Tuning into diffusion-based recommender systems. In contrast to prior RL approaches for diffusion models depending on external reward models, ReFiT adopts a task-aligned design: it formulates the denoising trajectory as a Markov decision process (MDP) and incorporates a collaborative signal-aware reward function that directly reflects recommendation quality. By tightly coupling the MDP structure with this reward signal, ReFiT empowers the RL agent to exploit high-order connectivity for fine-grained optimization, while avoiding the noisy or uninformative feedback common in naive reward designs. Leveraging policy gradient optimization, ReFiT maximizes exact log-likelihood of observed interactions, thereby enabling effective post hoc fine-tuning of diffusion recommenders. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ReFiT framework (a) exhibits substantial performance gains over strong competitors (up to 36.3% on sequential recommendation), (b) demonstrates strong efficiency with linear complexity in the number of users or items, and (c) generalizes well across multiple diffusion-based recommendation scenarios. The source code and datasets are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReFiT-4C60.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[LLaDA-Rec: Discrete Diffusion for Parallel Semantic ID Generation in Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06254v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation represents each item as a semantic ID, i.e., a sequence of discrete tokens, and generates the next item through autoregressive decoding. While effective, existing autoregressive models face two intrinsic limitations: (1) unidirectional constraints, where causal attention restricts each token to attend only to its predecessors, hindering global semantic modeling; and (2) error accumulation, where the fixed left-to-right generation order causes prediction errors in early tokens to propagate to the predictions of subsequent token. To address these issues, we propose LLaDA-Rec, a discrete diffusion framework that reformulates recommendation as parallel semantic ID generation. By combining bidirectional attention with the adaptive generation order, the approach models inter-item and intra-item dependencies more effectively and alleviates error accumulation. Specifically, our approach comprises three key designs: (1) a parallel tokenization scheme that produces semantic IDs for bidirectional modeling, addressing the mismatch between residual quantization and bidirectional architectures; (2) two masking mechanisms at the user-history and next-item levels to capture both inter-item sequential dependencies and intra-item semantic relationships; and (3) an adapted beam search strategy for adaptive-order discrete diffusion decoding, resolving the incompatibility of standard beam search with diffusion-based generation. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that LLaDA-Rec consistently outperforms both ID-based and state-of-the-art generative recommenders, establishing discrete diffusion as a new paradigm for generative recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Generative Recommendation with Continuous Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12007v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems (RecSys). Most existing LLM-based RecSys approaches operate in a discrete space, using vector-quantized tokenizers to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, these quantization methods often result in lossy tokenization and suboptimal learning, primarily due to inaccurate gradient propagation caused by the non-differentiable argmin operation in standard vector quantization. Inspired by the emerging trend of embracing continuous tokens in language models, we propose ContRec, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates continuous tokens into LLM-based RecSys. Specifically, ContRec consists of two key modules: a sigma-VAE Tokenizer, which encodes users/items with continuous tokens; and a Dispersive Diffusion module, which captures implicit user preference. The tokenizer is trained with a continuous Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) objective, where three effective techniques are adopted to avoid representation collapse. By conditioning on the previously generated tokens of the LLM backbone during user modeling, the Dispersive Diffusion module performs a conditional diffusion process with a novel Dispersive Loss, enabling high-quality user preference generation through next-token diffusion. Finally, ContRec leverages both the textual reasoning output from the LLM and the latent representations produced by the diffusion model for Top-K item retrieval, thereby delivering comprehensive recommendation results. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that ContRec consistently outperforms both traditional and SOTA LLM-based recommender systems. Our results highlight the potential of continuous tokenization and generative modeling for advancing the next generation of recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Listwise Preference Diffusion Optimization for User Behavior Trajectories Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00530v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting multi-step user behavior trajectories requires reasoning over structured preferences across future actions, a challenge overlooked by traditional sequential recommendation. This problem is critical for applications such as personalized commerce and adaptive content delivery, where anticipating a user's complete action sequence enhances both satisfaction and business outcomes. We identify an essential limitation of existing paradigms: their inability to capture global, listwise dependencies among sequence items. To address this, we formulate User Behavior Trajectory Prediction (UBTP) as a new task setting that explicitly models long-term user preferences. We introduce Listwise Preference Diffusion Optimization (LPDO), a diffusion-based training framework that directly optimizes structured preferences over entire item sequences. LPDO incorporates a Plackett-Luce supervision signal and derives a tight variational lower bound aligned with listwise ranking likelihoods, enabling coherent preference generation across denoising steps and overcoming the independent-token assumption of prior diffusion methods. To rigorously evaluate multi-step prediction quality, we propose the task-specific metric Sequential Match (SeqMatch), which measures exact trajectory agreement, and adopt Perplexity (PPL), which assesses probabilistic fidelity. Extensive experiments on real-world user behavior benchmarks demonstrate that LPDO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new benchmark for structured preference learning with diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Generative Recommendation: Data, Model, and Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27157v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems serve as foundational infrastructure in modern information ecosystems, helping users navigate digital content and discover items aligned with their preferences. At their core, recommender systems address a fundamental problem: matching users with items. Over the past decades, the field has experienced successive paradigm shifts, from collaborative filtering and matrix factorization in the machine learning era to neural architectures in the deep learning era. Recently, the emergence of generative models, especially large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, have sparked a new paradigm: generative recommendation, which reconceptualizes recommendation as a generation task rather than discriminative scoring. This survey provides a comprehensive examination through a unified tripartite framework spanning data, model, and task dimensions. Rather than simply categorizing works, we systematically decompose approaches into operational stages-data augmentation and unification, model alignment and training, task formulation and execution. At the data level, generative models enable knowledge-infused augmentation and agent-based simulation while unifying heterogeneous signals. At the model level, we taxonomize LLM-based methods, large recommendation models, and diffusion approaches, analyzing their alignment mechanisms and innovations. At the task level, we illuminate new capabilities including conversational interaction, explainable reasoning, and personalized content generation. We identify five key advantages: world knowledge integration, natural language understanding, reasoning capabilities, scaling laws, and creative generation. We critically examine challenges in benchmark design, model robustness, and deployment efficiency, while charting a roadmap toward intelligent recommendation assistants that fundamentally reshape human-information interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Efficiency-Effectiveness Trade-off of Diffusion-based Recommenders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17245v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative sequential recommendation, which typically generate next items to recommend guided by user interaction histories with a multi-step denoising process. However, the multi-step process relies on discrete approximations, introducing discretization error that creates a trade-off between computational efficiency and recommendation effectiveness. To address this trade-off, we propose TA-Rec, a two-stage framework that achieves one-step generation by smoothing the denoising function during pretraining while alleviating trajectory deviation by aligning with user preferences during fine-tuning. Specifically, to improve the efficiency without sacrificing the recommendation performance, TA-Rec pretrains the denoising model with Temporal Consistency Regularization (TCR), enforcing the consistency between the denoising results across adjacent steps. Thus, we can smooth the denoising function to map the noise as oracle items in one step with bounded error. To further enhance effectiveness, TA-Rec introduces Adaptive Preference Alignment (APA) that aligns the denoising process with user preference adaptively based on preference pair similarity and timesteps. Extensive experiments prove that TA-Rec's two-stage objective effectively mitigates the discretization errors-induced trade-off, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion-based recommenders.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Newborn to Impact: Bias-Aware Citation Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19246v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a key to accessing research impact, citation dynamics underpins research evaluation, scholarly recommendation, and the study of knowledge diffusion. Citation prediction is particularly critical for newborn papers, where early assessment must be performed without citation signals and under highly long-tailed distributions. We identify two key research gaps: (i) insufficient modeling of implicit factors of scientific impact, leading to reliance on coarse proxies; and (ii) a lack of bias-aware learning that can deliver stable predictions on lowly cited papers. We address these gaps by proposing a Bias-Aware Citation Prediction Framework, which combines multi-agent feature extraction with robust graph representation learning. First, a multi-agent x graph co-learning module derives fine-grained, interpretable signals, such as reproducibility, collaboration network, and text quality, from metadata and external resources, and fuses them with heterogeneous-network embeddings to provide rich supervision even in the absence of early citation signals. Second, we incorporate a set of robust mechanisms: a two-stage forward process that routes explicit factors through an intermediate exposure estimate, GroupDRO to optimize worst-case group risk across environments, and a regularization head that performs what-if analyses on controllable factors under monotonicity and smoothness constraints. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. Specifically, our model achieves around a 13% reduction in error metrics (MALE and RMSLE) and a notable 5.5% improvement in the ranking metric (NDCG) over the baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImageGem: In-the-wild Generative Image Interaction Dataset for Generative Model Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18433v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild and fine-grained user preference annotations. Our dataset features real-world interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables, for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffGRM: Diffusion-based Generative Recommendation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21805v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation (GR) is an emerging paradigm that represents each item via a tokenizer as an n-digit semantic ID (SID) and predicts the next item by autoregressively generating its SID conditioned on the user's history. However, two structural properties of SIDs make ARMs ill-suited. First, intra-item consistency: the n digits jointly specify one item, yet the left-to-right causality trains each digit only under its prefix and blocks bidirectional cross-digit evidence, collapsing supervision to a single causal path. Second, inter-digit heterogeneity: digits differ in semantic granularity and predictability, while the uniform next-token objective assigns equal weight to all digits, overtraining easy digits and undertraining hard digits. To address these two issues, we propose DiffGRM, a diffusion-based GR model that replaces the autoregressive decoder with a masked discrete diffusion model (MDM), thereby enabling bidirectional context and any-order parallel generation of SID digits for recommendation. Specifically, we tailor DiffGRM in three aspects: (1) tokenization with Parallel Semantic Encoding (PSE) to decouple digits and balance per-digit information; (2) training with On-policy Coherent Noising (OCN) that prioritizes uncertain digits via coherent masking to concentrate supervision on high-value signals; and (3) inference with Confidence-guided Parallel Denoising (CPD) that fills higher-confidence digits first and generates diverse Top-K candidates. Experiments show consistent gains over strong generative and discriminative recommendation baselines on multiple datasets, improving NDCG@10 by 6.9%-15.5%.

| **[Continuous Dynamic Modeling via Neural ODEs for Popularity Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18742v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity prediction for information cascades has significant applications across various domains, including opinion monitoring and advertising recommendations. While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21791v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaffold-Aware Generative Augmentation and Reranking for Enhanced Virtual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16306v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ligand-based virtual screening (VS) is an essential step in drug discovery that evaluates large chemical libraries to identify compounds that potentially bind to a therapeutic target. However, VS faces three major challenges: class imbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active molecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug.

Framed through the unifying perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis of Shashank Gupta defended at the University of Amsterdam on October 13th 2025</p></details> |
| **[Asking Clarifying Questions for Preference Elicitation With Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12015v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions and eliciting user preferences effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Denoising Diffusion as a New Framework for Underwater Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09934v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets, and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

| **[Energy-Guided Diffusion Sampling for Long-Term User Behavior Prediction in Reinforcement Learning-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12815v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning-based recommender systems (RL4RS) have gained attention for their ability to adapt to dynamic user preferences. However, these systems face challenges, particularly in offline settings, where data inefficiency and reliance on pre-collected trajectories limit their broader applicability. While offline reinforcement learning methods leverage extensive datasets to address these issues, they often struggle with noisy data and fail to capture long-term user preferences, resulting in suboptimal recommendation policies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diffusion-enhanced Actor-Critic for Offline RL4RS (DAC4Rec), a novel framework that integrates diffusion processes with reinforcement learning to model complex user preferences more effectively. DAC4Rec leverages the denoising capabilities of diffusion models to enhance the robustness of offline RL algorithms and incorporates a Q-value-guided policy optimization strategy to better handle suboptimal trajectories. Additionally, we introduce an energy-based sampling strategy to reduce randomness during recommendation generation, ensuring more targeted and reliable outcomes. We validate the effectiveness of DAC4Rec through extensive experiments on six real-world offline datasets and in an online simulation environment, demonstrating its ability to optimize long-term user preferences. Furthermore, we show that the proposed diffusion policy can be seamlessly integrated into other commonly used RL algorithms in RL4RS, highlighting its versatility and wide applicability.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |

However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data. The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation. In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Aware Diffusion for Signal Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05036v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of generating graph signals from unknown distributions defined over given graphs, relevant to domains such as recommender systems or sensor networks. Our approach builds on generative diffusion models, which are well established in vision and graph generation but remain underexplored for graph signals. Existing methods lack generality, either ignoring the graph structure in the forward process or designing graph-aware mechanisms tailored to specific domains. We adopt a forward process that incorporates the graph through the heat equation. Rather than relying on the standard formulation, we consider a time-warped coefficient to mitigate the exponential decay of the drift term, yielding a graph-aware generative diffusion model (GAD). We analyze its forward dynamics, proving convergence to a Gaussian Markov random field with covariance parametrized by the graph Laplacian, and interpret the backward dynamics as a sequence of graph-signal denoising problems. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of GAD on synthetic data, real traffic speed measurements, and a temperature sensor network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Handling Heterophily in Recommender Systems with Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14399v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are pivotal in delivering personalised user experiences across various domains. However, capturing the heterophily patterns and the multi-dimensional nature of user-item interactions poses significant challenges. To address this, we introduce FWHDNN (Fusion-based Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Networks), an innovative framework aimed at advancing representation learning in hypergraph-based recommendation tasks. The model incorporates three key components: (1) a cross-difference relation encoder leveraging heterophily-aware hypergraph diffusion to adapt message-passing for diverse class labels, (2) a multi-level cluster-wise encoder employing wavelet transform-based hypergraph neural network layers to capture multi-scale topological relationships, and (3) an integrated multi-modal fusion mechanism that combines structural and textual information through intermediate and late-fusion strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FWHDNN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and scalability in capturing high-order interconnections between users and items.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed and extended results</p></details> |
| **[Fading to Grow: Growing Preference Ratios via Preference Fading Discrete Diffusion for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26063v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommenders aim to rank items from a discrete item corpus in line with user interests, yet suffer from extremely sparse user preference data. Recent advances in diffusion models have inspired diffusion-based recommenders, which alleviate sparsity by injecting noise during a forward process to prevent the collapse of perturbed preference distributions. However, current diffusion-based recommenders predominantly rely on continuous Gaussian noise, which is intrinsically mismatched with the discrete nature of user preference data in recommendation. In this paper, building upon recent advances in discrete diffusion, we propose PreferGrow, a discrete diffusion-based recommender system that models preference ratios by fading and growing user preferences over the discrete item corpus. PreferGrow differs from existing diffusion-based recommenders in three core aspects: (1) Discrete modeling of preference ratios: PreferGrow models relative preference ratios between item pairs, rather than operating in the item representation or raw score simplex. This formulation aligns naturally with the discrete and ranking-oriented nature of recommendation tasks. (2) Perturbing via preference fading: Instead of injecting continuous noise, PreferGrow fades user preferences by replacing the preferred item with alternatives -- physically akin to negative sampling -- thereby eliminating the need for any prior noise assumption. (3) Preference reconstruction via growing: PreferGrow reconstructs user preferences by iteratively growing the preference signals from the estimated ratios. PreferGrow offers a well-defined matrix-based formulation with theoretical guarantees on Markovianity and reversibility, and it demonstrates consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art diffusion-based recommenders across five benchmark datasets, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and empirical effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Score Content and Performance Style for Joint Piano Rendering and Transcription](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23878v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expressive performance rendering (EPR) and automatic piano transcription (APT) are fundamental yet inverse tasks in music information retrieval: EPR generates expressive performances from symbolic scores, while APT recovers scores from performances. Despite their dual nature, prior work has addressed them independently. In this paper we propose a unified framework that jointly models EPR and APT by disentangling note-level score content and global performance style representations from both paired and unpaired data. Our framework is built on a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture and is trained using only sequence-aligned data, without requiring fine-grained note-level alignment. To automate the rendering process while ensuring stylistic compatibility with the score, we introduce an independent diffusion-based performance style recommendation module that generates style embeddings directly from score content. This modular component supports both style transfer and flexible rendering across a range of expressive styles. Experimental results from both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance on EPR and APT tasks, while enabling effective content-style disentanglement, reliable style transfer, and stylistically appropriate rendering.

| **[A Hierarchical Structure-Enhanced Personalized Recommendation Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulas Based on KG Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23560v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i) Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI, and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm for the recommendation of modern TCM.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, Proceedings of the 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)</p></details> |
| **[GSPRec: Temporal-Aware Graph Spectral Filtering for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11552v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based recommendation systems are effective at modeling collaborative patterns but often suffer from two limitations: overreliance on low-pass filtering, which suppresses user-specific signals, and omission of sequential dynamics in graph construction. We introduce GSPRec, a graph spectral model that integrates temporal transitions through sequentially-informed graph construction and applies frequency-aware filtering in the spectral domain. GSPRec encodes item transitions via multi-hop diffusion to enable the use of symmetric Laplacians for spectral processing. To capture user preferences, we design a dual-filtering mechanism: a Gaussian bandpass filter to extract mid-frequency, user-level patterns, and a low-pass filter to retain global trends. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that GSPRec consistently outperforms baselines, with an average improvement of 6.77% in NDCG@10. Ablation studies show the complementary benefits of both sequential graph augmentation and bandpass filtering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Long-term User Behaviors with Diffusion-driven Multi-interest Network for CTR Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15311v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CTR (Click-Through Rate) prediction, crucial for recommender systems and online advertising, etc., has been confirmed to benefit from modeling long-term user behaviors. Nonetheless, the vast number of behaviors and complexity of noise interference pose challenges to prediction efficiency and effectiveness. Recent solutions have evolved from single-stage models to two-stage models. However, current two-stage models often filter out significant information, resulting in an inability to capture diverse user interests and build the complete latent space of user interests. Inspired by multi-interest and generative modeling, we propose DiffuMIN (Diffusion-driven Multi-Interest Network) to model long-term user behaviors and thoroughly explore the user interest space. Specifically, we propose a target-oriented multi-interest extraction method that begins by orthogonally decomposing the target to obtain interest channels. This is followed by modeling the relationships between interest channels and user behaviors to disentangle and extract multiple user interests. We then adopt a diffusion module guided by contextual interests and interest channels, which anchor users' personalized and target-oriented interest types, enabling the generation of augmented interests that align with the latent spaces of user interests, thereby further exploring restricted interest space. Finally, we leverage contrastive learning to ensure that the generated augmented interests align with users' genuine preferences. Extensive offline experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, yielding results that demonstrate the superiority of DiffuMIN. Moreover, DiffuMIN increased CTR by 1.52% and CPM by 1.10% in online A/B testing. Our source code is available at https://github.com/laiweijiang/DiffuMIN.</p></details> |  |

We develop mathematical models to quantify the non-rivalry characteristics, partial excludability, and positive externalities of LLMs. Through comparative analysis of open-source and closed-source development paths, we identify systematic differences in resource allocation efficiency, innovation trajectories, and access equity. Our empirical research evaluates the spillover effects and network externalities of LLMs across different domains, including knowledge diffusion, innovation acceleration, and industry transformation. Based on these findings, we propose policy recommendations for balancing innovation incentives with equitable access, including public-private partnership mechanisms, computational resource democratization, and governance structures that optimize social welfare. This interdisciplinary approach contributes to understanding the economic nature of foundation AI models and provides policy guidance for their development as critical digital infrastructure</p></details> |  |
| **[Unpacking Musical Symbolism in Online Communities: Content-Based and Network-Centric Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00006v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines how musical symbolism is produced and circulated in online communities by combining content-based music analysis with a lightweight network perspective on lyrics. Using a curated corpus of 275 chart-topping songs enriched with audio descriptors (energy, danceability, loudness, liveness, valence, acousticness, speechiness, popularity) and full lyric transcripts, we build a reproducible pipeline that (i) quantifies temporal trends in sonic attributes, (ii) models lexical salience and co-occurrence, and (iii) profiles mood by genre. We find a decade-long decline in energy (79 -> 58) alongside a rise in danceability (59 -> 73); valence peaks in 2013 (63) and dips in 2014-2016 (42) before partially recovering. Correlation analysis shows strong coupling of energy with loudness (r = 0.74) and negative associations for acousticness with both energy (r = -0.54) and loudness (r = -0.51); danceability is largely orthogonal to other features (|r| < 0.20). Lyric tokenization (>114k tokens) reveals a pronoun-centric lexicon "I/you/me/my" and a dense co-occurrence structure in which interpersonal address anchors mainstream narratives. Mood differs systematically by style: R&B exhibits the highest mean valence (96), followed by K-Pop/Pop (77) and Indie/Pop (70), whereas Latin/Reggaeton is lower (37) despite high danceability. Read through a subcultural identity lens, these patterns suggest the mainstreaming of previously peripheral codes and a commercial preference for relaxed yet rhythmically engaging productions that sustain collective participation without maximal intensity. Methodologically, we contribute an integrated MIR-plus-network workflow spanning summary statistics, correlation structure, lexical co-occurrence matrices, and genre-wise mood profiling that is robust to modality sparsity and suitable for socially aware recommendation or community-level diffusion studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Negative Transfer: Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00389v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) leverages user behaviors across domains to enhance recommendation quality. However, naive aggregation of sequential signals can introduce conflicting domain-specific preferences, leading to negative transfer. While Sequential Recommendation (SR) already suffers from noisy behaviors such as misclicks and impulsive actions, CDSR further amplifies this issue due to domain heterogeneity arising from diverse item types and user intents. The core challenge is disentangling three intertwined signals: domain-invariant preferences, domain-specific preferences, and noise. Diffusion Models (DMs) offer a generative denoising framework well-suited for disentangling complex user preferences and enhancing robustness to noise. Their iterative refinement process enables gradual denoising, making them effective at capturing subtle preference signals. However, existing applications in recommendation face notable limitations: sequential DMs often conflate shared and domain-specific preferences, while cross-domain collaborative filtering DMs neglect temporal dynamics, limiting their ability to model evolving user preferences. To bridge these gaps, we propose \textbf{DPG-Diff}, a novel Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion Model, the first diffusion-based approach tailored for CDSR, to or best knowledge. DPG-Diff decomposes user preferences into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, which jointly guide the reverse diffusion process. This disentangled guidance enables robust cross-domain knowledge transfer, mitigates negative transfer, and filters sequential noise. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPG-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network for Click-through Rate Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21460v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex interactions between modalities. To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module, and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities, improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least 1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing multi-modal recommendation systems.

| **[Score-based Generative Diffusion Models for Social Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15579v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prevalence of social networks on online platforms, social recommendation has become a vital technique for enhancing personalized recommendations. The effectiveness of social recommendations largely relies on the social homophily assumption, which presumes that individuals with social connections often share similar preferences. However, this foundational premise has been recently challenged due to the inherent complexity and noise present in real-world social networks. In this paper, we tackle the low social homophily challenge from an innovative generative perspective, directly generating optimal user social representations that maximize consistency with collaborative signals. Specifically, we propose the Score-based Generative Model for Social Recommendation (SGSR), which effectively adapts the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)-based diffusion models for social recommendations. To better fit the recommendation context, SGSR employs a joint curriculum training strategy to mitigate challenges related to missing supervision signals and leverages self-supervised learning techniques to align knowledge across social and collaborative domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in filtering redundant social information and improving recommendation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering</p></details> |

CTR models critically depend on a large number of cross-features between the target item and the user to estimate the probability of clicking on the item, and discarding these cross-features will significantly impair model performance. Therefore, to harness the ability of generative models to understand data distributions and thereby alleviate the constraints of traditional discriminative models in label-scarce space, diverging from the item-generation paradigm of sequence generation methods, we propose a novel sample-level generation paradigm specifically designed for the CTR task: a two-stage Discrete Diffusion-Based Generative CTR training framework (DGenCTR). This two-stage framework comprises a diffusion-based generative pre-training stage and a CTR-targeted supervised fine-tuning stage for CTR. Finally, extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing conclusively validate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Preference Trajectory Modeling via Flow Matching for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17618v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation predicts each user's next item based on their historical interaction sequence. Recently, diffusion models have attracted significant attention in this area due to their strong ability to model user interest distributions. They typically generate target items by denoising Gaussian noise conditioned on historical interactions. However, these models face two critical limitations. First, they exhibit high sensitivity to the condition, making it difficult to recover target items from pure Gaussian noise. Second, the inference process is computationally expensive, limiting practical deployment. To address these issues, we propose FlowRec, a simple yet effective sequential recommendation framework which leverages flow matching to explicitly model user preference trajectories from current states to future interests. Flow matching is an emerging generative paradigm, which offers greater flexibility in initial distributions and enables more efficient sampling. Based on this, we construct a personalized behavior-based prior distribution to replace Gaussian noise and learn a vector field to model user preference trajectories. To better align flow matching with the recommendation objective, we further design a single-step alignment loss incorporating both positive and negative samples, improving sampling efficiency and generation quality. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the superiority of FlowRec over the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-to-Slate: Diffusion Models for Prompt-Conditioned Slate Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06883v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Slate generation is a common task in streaming and e-commerce platforms, where multiple items are presented together as a list or ``slate''. Traditional systems focus mostly on item-level ranking and often fail to capture the coherence of the slate as a whole. A key challenge lies in the combinatorial nature of selecting multiple items jointly. To manage this, conventional approaches often assume users interact with only one item at a time, assumption that breaks down when items are meant to be consumed together. In this paper, we introduce DMSG, a generative framework based on diffusion models for prompt-conditioned slate generation. DMSG learns high-dimensional structural patterns and generates coherent, diverse slates directly from natural language prompts. Unlike retrieval-based or autoregressive models, DMSG models the joint distribution over slates, enabling greater flexibility and diversity. We evaluate DMSG in two key domains: music playlist generation and e-commerce bundle creation. In both cases, DMSG produces high-quality slates from textual prompts without explicit personalization signals. Offline and online results show that DMSG outperforms strong baselines in both relevance and diversity, offering a scalable, low-latency solution for prompt-driven recommendation. A live A/B test on a production playlist system further demonstrates increased user engagement and content diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Asymmetric Diffusion Recommendation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12706v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, motivated by the outstanding achievements of diffusion models, the diffusion process has been employed to strengthen representation learning in recommendation systems. Most diffusion-based recommendation models typically utilize standard Gaussian noise in symmetric forward and reverse processes in continuous data space. Nevertheless, the samples derived from recommendation systems inhabit a discrete data space, which is fundamentally different from the continuous one. Moreover, Gaussian noise has the potential to corrupt personalized information within latent representations. In this work, we propose a novel and effective method, named Asymmetric Diffusion Recommendation Model (AsymDiffRec), which learns forward and reverse processes in an asymmetric manner. We define a generalized forward process that simulates the missing features in real-world recommendation samples. The reverse process is then performed in an asymmetric latent feature space. To preserve personalized information within the latent representation, a task-oriented optimization strategy is introduced. In the serving stage, the raw sample with missing features is regarded as a noisy input to generate a denoising and robust representation for the final prediction. By equipping base models with AsymDiffRec, we conduct online A/B tests, achieving improvements of +0.131% and +0.166% in terms of users' active days and app usage duration respectively. Additionally, the extended offline experiments also demonstrate improvements. AsymDiffRec has been implemented in the Douyin Music App.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM2025 |
| **[Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion Model for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07243v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heuristic negative sampling enhances recommendation performance by selecting negative samples of varying hardness levels from predefined candidate pools to guide the model toward learning more accurate decision boundaries. However, our empirical and theoretical analyses reveal that unobserved environmental confounders (e.g., exposure or popularity biases) in candidate pools may cause heuristic sampling methods to introduce false hard negatives (FHNS). These misleading samples can encourage the model to learn spurious correlations induced by such confounders, ultimately compromising its generalization ability under distribution shifts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion (CNSDiff). By synthesizing negative samples in the latent space via a conditional diffusion process, CNSDiff avoids the bias introduced by predefined candidate pools and thus reduces the likelihood of generating FHNS. Moreover, it incorporates a causal regularization term to explicitly mitigate the influence of environmental confounders during the negative sampling process, leading to robust negatives that promote out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Comprehensive experiments under four representative distribution shift scenarios demonstrate that CNSDiff achieves an average improvement of 13.96% across all evaluation metrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines, verifying its effectiveness and robustness in OOD recommendation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, Under-review</p></details> |
| **[How Fair is Your Diffusion Recommender Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04339v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based learning has settled as a rising paradigm in generative recommendation, outperforming traditional approaches built upon variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. Despite their effectiveness, concerns have been raised that diffusion models - widely adopted in other machine-learning domains - could potentially lead to unfair outcomes, since they are trained to recover data distributions that often encode inherent biases. Motivated by the related literature, and acknowledging the extensive discussion around bias and fairness aspects in recommendation, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first empirical study of fairness for DiffRec, chronologically the pioneer technique in diffusion-based recommendation. Our empirical study involves DiffRec and its variant L-DiffRec, tested against nine recommender systems on two benchmarking datasets to assess recommendation utility and fairness from both consumer and provider perspectives. Specifically, we first evaluate the utility and fairness dimensions separately and, then, within a multi-criteria setting to investigate whether, and to what extent, these approaches can achieve a trade-off between the two. While showing worrying trends in alignment with the more general machine-learning literature on diffusion models, our results also indicate promising directions to address the unfairness issue in future work.

| **[Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation with Conditional Diffusion-Based Feature Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05352v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sequential recommendation system utilizes historical user interactions to predict preferences. Effectively integrating diverse user behavior patterns with rich multimodal information of items to enhance the accuracy of sequential recommendations is an emerging and challenging research direction. This paper focuses on the problem of multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation, aiming to address the following challenges: (1) the lack of effective characterization of modal preferences across different behaviors, as user attention to different item modalities varies depending on the behavior; (2) the difficulty of effectively mitigating implicit noise in user behavior, such as unintended actions like accidental clicks; (3) the inability to handle modality noise in multi-modal representations, which further impacts the accurate modeling of user preferences. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation model (M$^3$BSR). This model first removes noise in multi-modal representations using a Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer. Subsequently, it utilizes deep behavioral information to guide the denoising of shallow behavioral data, thereby alleviating the impact of noise in implicit feedback through Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising. Finally, by introducing a Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer, M$^3$BSR explicitly models the common and specific interests across behaviors and modalities to enhance recommendation performance. Experimental results indicate that M$^3$BSR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.</p></details> | SIGIR 2025 |

To alleviate data sparsity and interest drift issues, conventional approaches typically incorporate auxiliary behaviors from other domains via cross-domain transition. However, existing cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) methods often follow an align-then-fusion paradigm that performs representation-level alignment across multiple domains and combines them mechanically for recommendation, overlooking the fine-grained fusion of domain-specific preferences. Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) for distribution matching, we propose an align-for-fusion framework for CDSR to harmonize triple preferences via dual-oriented DMs, termed HorizonRec. Specifically, we investigate the uncertainty injection of DMs and identify stochastic noise as a key source of instability in existing DM-based recommenders. To address this, we introduce a mixed-conditioned distribution retrieval strategy that leverages distributions retrieved from users' authentic behavioral logic as semantic bridges across domains, enabling consistent multi-domain preference modeling. Furthermore, we propose a dual-oriented preference diffusion method to suppress potential noise and emphasize target-relevant interests during multi-domain user representation fusion. Extensive experiments on four CDSR datasets from two distinct platforms demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of HorizonRec in fine-grained triple-domain preference fusion.</p></details> |  |

Unleashing Generative Attention for Dynamic Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02050v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential Recommendation (SR) focuses on personalizing user experiences by predicting future preferences based on historical interactions. Transformer models, with their attention mechanisms, have become the dominant architecture in SR tasks due to their ability to capture dependencies in user behavior sequences. However, traditional attention mechanisms, where attention weights are computed through query-key transformations, are inherently linear and deterministic. This fixed approach limits their ability to account for the dynamic and non-linear nature of user preferences, leading to challenges in capturing evolving interests and subtle behavioral patterns. Given that generative models excel at capturing non-linearity and probabilistic variability, we argue that generating attention distributions offers a more flexible and expressive alternative compared to traditional attention mechanisms. To support this claim, we present a theoretical proof demonstrating that generative attention mechanisms offer greater expressiveness and stochasticity than traditional deterministic approaches. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we introduce two generative attention models for SR, each grounded in the principles of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Diffusion Models (DMs), respectively. These models are designed specifically to generate adaptive attention distributions that better align with variable user preferences. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show our models significantly outperform state-of-the-art in both accuracy and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACMMM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Controllable and Stealthy Shilling Attacks via Dispersive Latent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01987v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RSs) are now fundamental to various online platforms, but their dependence on user-contributed data leaves them vulnerable to shilling attacks that can manipulate item rankings by injecting fake users. Although widely studied, most existing attack models fail to meet two critical objectives simultaneously: achieving strong adversarial promotion of target items while maintaining realistic behavior to evade detection. As a result, the true severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives remains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present DLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet indistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target promotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding space, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively synthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade detection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes variability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that, compared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion while remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are more vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses.</p></details> |  |

These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-powered Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.</p></details> | <details><summary>706 p...</summary><p>706 papers, 60 pages, 3 figures, 14 tables; GitHub: https://github.com/xingjunm/Awesome-Large-Model-Safety</p></details> |

However, their robustness against adversarial attacks remains largely underexplored, posing significant risks to system reliability and security. Existing attack strategies suffer from notable limitations: shilling attacks are costly and detectable, and visual-only perturbations often fail to align with user preferences. To address these challenges, we propose AUV-Fusion, a cross-modal adversarial attack framework that adopts high-order user preference modeling and cross-modal adversary generation. Specifically, we obtain robust user embeddings through multi-hop user-item interactions and transform them via an MLP into semantically aligned perturbations. These perturbations are injected onto the latent space of a pre-trained VAE within the diffusion model. By synergistically integrating genuine user interaction data with visually plausible perturbations, AUV-Fusion eliminates the need for injecting fake user profiles and effectively mitigates the challenge of insufficient user preference extraction inherent in traditional visual-only attacks. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse VARS architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate that AUV-Fusion significantly enhances the exposure of target (cold-start) items compared to conventional baseline methods. Moreover, AUV-Fusion maintains exceptional stealth under rigorous scrutiny.</p></details> | 14 pages,6 figures |

Although knowledge-free models are able to bolster recommendations by direct edge operations as well, the absence of augmentation primitives drives them to fall short in bridging semantic and structural gaps as high-quality paradigm substitutes. Unlike existing diffusion-based works that remodel user-item interactions, this work proposes NodeDiffRec, a pioneering knowledge-free augmentation framework that enables fine-grained node-level graph generation for recommendations and expands the scope of restricted augmentation primitives via diffusion. By synthesizing pseudo-items and corresponding interactions that align with the underlying distribution for injection, and further refining user preferences through a denoising preference modeling process, NodeDiffRec dramatically enhances both semantic diversity and structural connectivity without external knowledge. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and recommendation algorithms demonstrate the superiority of NodeDiffRec, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance, with maximum average performance improvement 98.6% in Recall@5 and 84.0% in NDCG@5 over selected baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-aware Diffusion-Enhanced Multimedia Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16396v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimedia recommendations aim to use rich multimedia content to enhance historical user-item interaction information, which can not only indicate the content relatedness among items but also reveal finer-grained preferences of users. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-aware Diffusion-Enhanced architecture using contrastive learning paradigms (KDiffE) for multimedia recommendations. Specifically, we first utilize original user-item graphs to build an attention-aware matrix into graph neural networks, which can learn the importance between users and items for main view construction. The attention-aware matrix is constructed by adopting a random walk with a restart strategy, which can preserve the importance between users and items to generate aggregation of attention-aware node features. Then, we propose a guided diffusion model to generate strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs with less noise for constructing a knowledge-aware contrastive view, which utilizes user embeddings with an edge connected to an item to guide the generation of strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs for enhancing the item's semantic information. We perform comprehensive experiments on three multimedia datasets that reveal the effectiveness of our KDiffE and its components on various state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Similarity-Guided Diffusion for Contrastive Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11866v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In sequential recommendation systems, data augmentation and contrastive learning techniques have recently been introduced using diffusion models to achieve robust representation learning. However, most of the existing approaches use random augmentation, which risk damaging the contextual information of the original sequence. Accordingly, we propose a Similarity-Guided Diffusion for Contrastive Sequential Recommendation. Our method leverages the similarity between item embedding vectors to generate semantically consistent noise. Moreover, we utilize high confidence score in the denoising process to select our augmentation positions. This approach more effectively reflects contextual and structural information compared to augmentation at random positions. From a contrastive learning perspective, the proposed augmentation technique provides more discriminative positive and negative samples, simultaneously improving training efficiency and recommendation performance. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that SimDiffRec outperforms the existing baseline models.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Alleviating User-Sensitive bias with Fair Generative Sequential Recommendation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19777v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation fairness has recently attracted much attention. In the real world, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with the same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same patterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation preference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness. Diffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great success in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and represent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of adaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore, we use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the diversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model based on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the original distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition model, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse reconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is completed by injecting multi-interests representational information that eliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In the inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition by using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to reconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on accuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes the degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unconditional Diffusion for Generative Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06121v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, known for their generative ability to simulate data creation through noise-adding and denoising processes, have emerged as a promising approach for building generative recommenders. To incorporate user history for personalization, existing methods typically adopt a conditional diffusion framework, where the reverse denoising process of reconstructing items from noise is modified to be conditioned on the user history. However, this design may fail to fully utilize historical information, as it gets distracted by the need to model the "item $\leftrightarrow$ noise" translation. This motivates us to reformulate the diffusion process for sequential recommendation in an unconditional manner, treating user history (instead of noise) as the endpoint of the forward diffusion process (i.e., the starting point of the reverse process), rather than as a conditional input. This formulation allows for exclusive focus on modeling the "item $\leftrightarrow$ history" translation. To this end, we introduce Brownian Bridge Diffusion Recommendation (BBDRec). By leveraging a Brownian bridge process, BBDRec enforces a structured noise addition and denoising mechanism, ensuring that the trajectories are constrained towards a specific endpoint -- user history, rather than noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate BBDRec's effectiveness in enhancing sequential recommendation performance. The source code is available at https://github.com/baiyimeng/BBDRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Multimodal Data and Side Users for Diffusion Cross-Domain Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04000v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to address the persistent cold-start problem in Recommender Systems. Current CDR research concentrates on transferring cold-start users' information from the auxiliary domain to the target domain. However, these systems face two main issues: the underutilization of multimodal data, which hinders effective cross-domain alignment, and the neglect of side users who interact solely within the target domain, leading to inadequate learning of the target domain's vector space distribution. To address these issues, we propose a model leveraging Multimodal data and Side users for diffusion Cross-domain recommendation (MuSiC). We first employ a multimodal large language model to extract item multimodal features and leverage a large language model to uncover user features using prompt learning without fine-tuning. Secondly, we propose the cross-domain diffusion module to learn the generation of feature vectors in the target domain. This approach involves learning feature distribution from side users and understanding the patterns in cross-domain transformation through overlapping users. Subsequently, the trained diffusion module is used to generate feature vectors for cold-start users in the target domain, enabling the completion of cross-domain recommendation tasks. Finally, our experimental evaluation of the Amazon dataset confirms that MuSiC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming all selected baselines. Our code is available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MuSiC-310A/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Recommender Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04971v3)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are widely utilized to model the generative process of user interactions. However, these generative models suffer from intrinsic limitations such as the instability of GANs and the restricted representation ability of VAEs. Such limitations hinder the accurate modeling of the complex user interaction generation procedure, such as noisy interactions caused by various interference factors. In light of the impressive advantages of Diffusion Models (DMs) over traditional generative models in image synthesis, we propose a novel Diffusion Recommender Model (named DiffRec) to learn the generative process in a denoising manner. To retain personalized information in user interactions, DiffRec reduces the added noises and avoids corrupting users' interactions into pure noises like in image synthesis. In addition, we extend traditional DMs to tackle the unique challenges in practical recommender systems: high resource costs for large-scale item prediction and temporal shifts of user preference. To this end, we propose two extensions of DiffRec: L-DiffRec clusters items for dimension compression and conducts the diffusion processes in the latent space; and T-DiffRec reweights user interactions based on the interaction timestamps to encode temporal information. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets under multiple settings (e.g. clean training, noisy training, and temporal training). The empirical results and in-depth analysis validate the superiority of DiffRec with two extensions over competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in SIGIR'23</p></details> |

Given the great generation capability exhibited by diffusion models in computer vision recently, many recommender systems have adopted diffusion models and found improvements in performance for various tasks. Research in this domain has been growing rapidly and calling for a systematic survey. In this survey paper, we present and propose a taxonomy in recommender systems that utilize diffusion models. Distinct from a prior survey paper that categorizes based on the role of the diffusion model, we categorize based on the recommendation task at hand. The decision originates from the rationale that after all, the adoption of diffusion models is to enhance the recommendation performance, not vice versa: adapting the recommendation task to enable diffusion models. Nonetheless, we offer a unique perspective for diffusion models in recommender systems complementary to existing surveys. We present the foundational algorithms in diffusion models and their applications in recommender systems to summarize the rapid development in this field. Finally, we discuss open research directions to prepare and encourage further efforts to advance the field. We compile the relevant papers in a public GitHub repository.</p></details> | 38 pages |

However, uncontrolled reproduction of sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful imagery poses serious ethical, legal, and safety challenges. To address these concerns, the concept erasure paradigm has emerged as a promising direction, enabling the selective removal of specific semantic concepts from generative models while preserving their overall utility. This survey provides a comprehensive overview and in-depth synthesis of concept erasure techniques in T2I diffusion models. We systematically categorize existing approaches along three key dimensions: intervention level, which identifies specific model components targeted for concept removal; optimization structure, referring to the algorithmic strategies employed to achieve suppression; and semantic scope, concerning the complexity and nature of the concepts addressed. This multi-dimensional taxonomy enables clear, structured comparisons across diverse methodologies, highlighting fundamental trade-offs between erasure specificity, generalization, and computational complexity. We further discuss current evaluation benchmarks, standardized metrics, and practical datasets, emphasizing gaps that limit comprehensive assessment, particularly regarding robustness and practical effectiveness. Finally, we outline major challenges and promising future directions, including disentanglement of concept representations, adaptive and incremental erasure strategies, adversarial robustness, and new generative architectures. This survey aims to guide researchers toward safer, more ethically aligned generative models, providing foundational knowledge and actionable recommendations to advance responsible development in generative AI.</p></details> |  |

Diverging from previous diffusion-based methods, ADRec applies an independent noise process to each token and performs diffusion across the entire target sequence during training. ADRec captures token interdependency through auto-regression while modeling per-token distributions through token-level diffusion. This dual approach enables the model to effectively capture both sequence dynamics and item representations, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. To further mitigate embedding collapse, we propose a three-stage training strategy: (1) pre-training the embedding weights, (2) aligning these weights with the ADRec backbone, and (3) fine-tuning the model. During inference, ADRec applies the denoising process only to the last token, ensuring that the meaningful patterns in historical interactions are preserved. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation across six datasets underscores the effectiveness of ADRec in enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of diffusion-based sequential recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |

Yet their widespread adoption poses challenges regarding data attribution and interpretability. In this paper, we aim to help address such challenges in diffusion models by developing an influence functions framework. Influence function-based data attribution methods approximate how a model's output would have changed if some training data were removed. In supervised learning, this is usually used for predicting how the loss on a particular example would change. For diffusion models, we focus on predicting the change in the probability of generating a particular example via several proxy measurements. We show how to formulate influence functions for such quantities and how previously proposed methods can be interpreted as particular design choices in our framework. To ensure scalability of the Hessian computations in influence functions, we systematically develop K-FAC approximations based on generalised Gauss-Newton matrices specifically tailored to diffusion models. We recast previously proposed methods as specific design choices in our framework and show that our recommended method outperforms previous data attribution approaches on common evaluations, such as the Linear Data-modelling Score (LDS) or retraining without top influences, without the need for method-specific hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately modeling user preferences remains challenging due to the noise perturbations inherent in the forward and reverse processes of diffusion-based methods. Towards this end, this study introduces FMRec, a Flow Matching based model that employs a straight flow trajectory and a modified loss tailored for the recommendation task. Additionally, from the diffusion-model perspective, we integrate a reconstruction loss to improve robustness against noise perturbations, thereby retaining user preferences during the forward process. In the reverse process, we employ a deterministic reverse sampler, specifically an ODE-based updating function, to eliminate unnecessary randomness, thereby ensuring that the generated recommendations closely align with user needs. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets reveal that FMRec achieves an average improvement of 6.53% over state-of-the-art methods.

However, the sparser interactions between users and bundles raise a big challenge, especially in cold-start scenarios. Traditional collaborative filtering methods do not work well for this kind of problem because these models rely on interactions to update the latent embedding, which is hard to work in a cold-start setting. We propose a new approach (DisCo), which relies on a personalized Diffusion backbone, enhanced by disentangled aspects for the user's interest, to generate a bundle in distribution space for each user to tackle the cold-start challenge. During the training phase, DisCo adjusts an additional objective loss term to avoid bias, a prevalent issue while using the generative model for top-$K$ recommendation purposes. Our empirical experiments show that DisCo outperforms five comparative baselines by a large margin on three real-world datasets. Thereby, this study devises a promising framework and essential viewpoints in cold-start recommendation.

| **[Addressing Missing Data Issue for Diffusion-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12283v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown significant potential in generating oracle items that best match user preference with guidance from user historical interaction sequences. However, the quality of guidance is often compromised by unpredictable missing data in observed sequence, leading to suboptimal item generation. Since missing data is uncertain in both occurrence and content, recovering it is impractical and may introduce additional errors. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel dual-side Thompson sampling-based Diffusion Model (TDM), which simulates extra missing data in the guidance signals and allows diffusion models to handle existing missing data through extrapolation. To preserve user preference evolution in sequences despite extra missing data, we introduce Dual-side Thompson Sampling to implement simulation with two probability models, sampling by exploiting user preference from both item continuity and sequence stability. TDM strategically removes items from sequences based on dual-side Thompson sampling and treats these edited sequences as guidance for diffusion models, enhancing models' robustness to missing data through consistency regularization. Additionally, to enhance the generation efficiency, TDM is implemented under the denoising diffusion implicit models to accelerate the reverse process. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis validate the effectiveness of TDM in addressing missing data in sequential recommendations.</p></details> |  |

However, earlier reproducibility studies indicate that progress in this area may be quite limited. Specifically, various widespread methodological issues, e.g., comparisons with untuned baseline models, have led to an \emph{illusion of progress}. In this work, our goal is to examine whether these problems persist in today's research. To this end, we aim to reproduce the latest advancements reported from applying modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to recommender systems, focusing on four models published at the top-ranked SIGIR conference in 2023 and 2024. Our findings are concerning, revealing persistent methodological problems. Alarmingly, through experiments, we find that the latest recommendation techniques based on diffusion models, despite their computational complexity and substantial carbon footprint, are consistently outperformed by simpler existing models. Furthermore, we identify key mismatches between the characteristics of diffusion models and those of the traditional \emph{top-n} recommendation task, raising doubts about their suitability for recommendation. We also note that, in the papers we analyze, the generative capabilities of these models are constrained to a minimum. Overall, our results and continued methodological issues call for greater scientific rigor and a disruptive change in the research and publication culture in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Information Diffusion Beyond Explicit Social Ties: A Study of Implicit-Link Diffusion on Twitter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08354v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information diffusion on social media platforms is often assumed to occur primarily through explicit social connections, such as follower or friend relationships. However, information frequently propagates beyond these observable ties -- via external websites, search engines, or algorithmic recommendations -- forming implicit links between users who are not directly connected. Despite their potential impact, the mechanisms and characteristics of such implicit-link diffusion remain underexplored. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of nontrivial information diffusion mediated by implicit links on Twitter, using four large-scale datasets. We define implicit-link diffusion as the reposting of content by users who are not explicitly connected to the original poster. Our analysis reveals that users located farther from the original source in the social network are more likely to engage in diffusion through implicit links, suggesting that such links often arise from sources outside direct social relationships. Moreover, while implicit links contribute less to the overall diffusion size than explicit links, they play a distinct role in disseminating content across diverse and topologically distant communities. We further identify user groups who predominantly engage in diffusion through either explicit or implicit links, and demonstrate that the choice of diffusion channel exhibits strong patterns of social homophily. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating implicit-link dynamics into models of information diffusion and social influence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-driven SpatioTemporal Graph KANsformer for Medical Examination Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07431v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems in AI-based medical diagnostics and treatment constitute a critical component of AI in healthcare. Although some studies have explored this area and made notable progress, healthcare recommendation systems remain in their nascent stage. And these researches mainly target the treatment process such as drug or disease recommendations. In addition to the treatment process, the diagnostic process, particularly determining which medical examinations are necessary to evaluate the condition, also urgently requires intelligent decision support. To bridge this gap, we first formalize the task of medical examination recommendations. Compared to traditional recommendations, the medical examination recommendation involves more complex interactions. This complexity arises from two folds: 1) The historical medical records for examination recommendations are heterogeneous and redundant, which makes the recommendation results susceptible to noise. 2) The correlation between the medical history of patients is often irregular, making it challenging to model spatiotemporal dependencies. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel Diffusion-driven SpatioTemporal Graph KANsformer for Medical Examination Recommendation (DST-GKAN) with a two-stage learning paradigm to solve the above challenges. In the first stage, we exploit a task-adaptive diffusion model to distill recommendation-oriented information by reducing the noises in heterogeneous medical data. In the second stage, a spatiotemporal graph KANsformer is proposed to simultaneously model the complex spatial and temporal relationships. Moreover, to facilitate the medical examination recommendation research, we introduce a comprehensive dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method compared to various competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReCDAP: Relation-Based Conditional Diffusion with Attention Pooling for Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07171v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graphs (KGs), composed of triples in the form of (head, relation, tail) and consisting of entities and relations, play a key role in information retrieval systems such as question answering, entity search, and recommendation. In real-world KGs, although many entities exist, the relations exhibit a long-tail distribution, which can hinder information retrieval performance. Previous few-shot knowledge graph completion studies focused exclusively on the positive triple information that exists in the graph or, when negative triples were incorporated, used them merely as a signal to indicate incorrect triples. To overcome this limitation, we propose Relation-Based Conditional Diffusion with Attention Pooling (ReCDAP). First, negative triples are generated by randomly replacing the tail entity in the support set. By conditionally incorporating positive information in the KG and non-existent negative information into the diffusion process, the model separately estimates the latent distributions for positive and negative relations. Moreover, including an attention pooler enables the model to leverage the differences between positive and negative cases explicitly. Experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at https://github.com/hou27/ReCDAP-FKGC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025, 5 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Divide-and-Conquer: Cold-Start Bundle Recommendation via Mixture of Diffusion Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05035v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cold-start bundle recommendation focuses on modeling new bundles with insufficient information to provide recommendations. Advanced bundle recommendation models usually learn bundle representations from multiple views (e.g., interaction view) at both the bundle and item levels. Consequently, the cold-start problem for bundles is more challenging than that for traditional items due to the dual-level multi-view complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel Mixture of Diffusion Experts (MoDiffE) framework, which employs a divide-and-conquer strategy for cold-start bundle recommendation and follows three steps:(1) Divide: The bundle cold-start problem is divided into independent but similar sub-problems sequentially by level and view, which can be summarized as the poor representation of feature-missing bundles in prior-embedding models. (2) Conquer: Beyond prior-embedding models that fundamentally provide the embedded representations, we introduce a diffusion-based method to solve all sub-problems in a unified way, which directly generates diffusion representations using diffusion models without depending on specific features. (3) Combine: A cold-aware hierarchical Mixture of Experts (MoE) is employed to combine results of the sub-problems for final recommendations, where the two models for each view serve as experts and are adaptively fused for different bundles in a multi-layer manner. Additionally, MoDiffE adopts a multi-stage decoupled training pipeline and introduces a cold-start gating augmentation method to enable the training of gating for cold bundles. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that MoDiffE significantly outperforms existing solutions in handling cold-start bundle recommendation. It achieves up to a 0.1027 absolute gain in Recall@20 in cold-start scenarios and up to a 47.43\% relative improvement in all-bundle scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Generative models (GMs) offer an alternative by creating synthetic samples that resemble real-world images. However, existing research primarily relies on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)-based image-to-image translation and lack a comprehensive analysis of computational requirements in agriculture. Therefore, this research explores a multi-modal text-to-image approach for generating synthetic crop disease images and is the first to provide computational benchmarking in this context. We trained three Stable Diffusion (SD) variants-SDXL, SD3.5M (medium), and SD3.5L (large)-and fine-tuned them using Dreambooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning techniques to enhance generalization. SD3.5M outperformed the others, with an average memory usage of 18 GB, power consumption of 180 W, and total energy use of 1.02 kWh/500 images (0.002 kWh per image) during inference task. Our results demonstrate SD3.5M's ability to generate 500 synthetic images from just 36 in-field samples in 1.5 hours. We recommend SD3.5M for efficient crop disease data generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[AlphaFuse: Learn ID Embeddings for Sequential Recommendation in Null Space of Language Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19218v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in sequential recommendation have underscored the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhancing item embeddings. However, existing approaches face three key limitations: 1) the degradation of the semantic space when high-dimensional language embeddings are mapped to lower-dimensional ID embeddings, 2) the underutilization of language embeddings, and 3) the reliance on additional trainable parameters, such as an adapter, to bridge the gap between the semantic and behavior spaces. In this paper, we introduce AlphaFuse, a simple but effective language-guided learning strategy that addresses these challenges by learning ID embeddings within the null space of language embeddings. Specifically, we decompose the semantic space of language embeddings via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), distinguishing it into a semantic-rich row space and a semantic-sparse null space. Collaborative signals are then injected into the null space, while preserving the rich semantics of the row space. AlphaFuse prevents degradation of the semantic space, integrates the retained language embeddings into the final item embeddings, and eliminates the need for auxiliary trainable modules, enabling seamless adaptation to any sequential recommendation framework. We validate the effectiveness and flexibility of AlphaFuse through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, including cold-start user and long-tail settings, showcasing significant improvements in both discriminative and diffusion-based generative sequential recommenders. Our codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Hugo-Chinn/AlphaFuse.</p></details> | Accepted by SIGIR'25 |
| **[Intent-aware Diffusion with Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16077v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has proven effective in training sequential recommendation models by incorporating self-supervised signals from augmented views. Most existing methods generate multiple views from the same interaction sequence through stochastic data augmentation, aiming to align their representations in the embedding space. However, users typically have specific intents when purchasing items (e.g., buying clothes as gifts or cosmetics for beauty). Random data augmentation used in existing methods may introduce noise, disrupting the latent intent information implicit in the original interaction sequence. Moreover, using noisy augmented sequences in contrastive learning may mislead the model to focus on irrelevant features, distorting the embedding space and failing to capture users' true behavior patterns and intents. To address these issues, we propose Intent-aware Diffusion with contrastive learning for sequential Recommendation (InDiRec). The core idea is to generate item sequences aligned with users' purchasing intents, thus providing more reliable augmented views for contrastive learning. Specifically, InDiRec first performs intent clustering on sequence representations using K-means to build intent-guided signals. Next, it retrieves the intent representation of the target interaction sequence to guide a conditional diffusion model, generating positive views that share the same underlying intent. Finally, contrastive learning is applied to maximize representation consistency between these intent-aligned views and the original sequence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that InDiRec achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines, learning more robust representations even under noisy and sparse data conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025. 10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[PIV-FlowDiffuser:Transfer-learning-based denoising diffusion models for PIV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14952v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning algorithms have significantly reduced the computational time and improved the spatial resolution of particle image velocimetry~(PIV). However, the models trained on synthetic datasets might have a degraded performance on practical particle images due to domain gaps. As a result, special residual patterns are often observed for the vector fields of deep learning-based estimators. To reduce the special noise step-by-step, we employ a denoising diffusion model~(FlowDiffuser) for PIV analysis. And the data-hungry iterative denoising diffusion model is trained via a transfer learning strategy, resulting in our PIV-FlowDiffuser method. Specifically, (1) pre-training a FlowDiffuser model with multiple optical flow datasets of the computer vision community, such as Sintel, KITTI, etc; (2) fine-tuning the pre-trained model on synthetic PIV datasets. Note that the PIV images are upsampled by a factor of two to resolve the small-scale turbulent flow structures. The visualized results indicate that our PIV-FlowDiffuser effectively suppresses the noise patterns. Therefore, the denoising diffusion model reduces the average end-point error~($AEE$) by 59.4% over RAFT256-PIV baseline on the classic Cai's dataset. Besides, PIV-FlowDiffuser exhibits enhanced generalization performance on unseen particle images due to transfer learning. Overall, this study highlights the transfer-learning-based denoising diffusion models for PIV. And a detailed implementation is recommended for interested readers in the repository https://github.com/Zhu-Qianyu/PIV-FlowDiffuser.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference Diffusion for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13117v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems predict personalized item rankings based on user preference distributions derived from historical behavior data. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have gained attention in recommendation for their ability to model complex distributions, yet current DM-based recommenders often rely on traditional objectives like mean squared error (MSE) or recommendation objectives, which are not optimized for personalized ranking tasks or fail to fully leverage DM's generative potential. To address this, we propose PreferDiff, a tailored optimization objective for DM-based recommenders. PreferDiff transforms BPR into a log-likelihood ranking objective and integrates multiple negative samples to better capture user preferences. Specifically, we employ variational inference to handle the intractability through minimizing the variational upper bound and replaces MSE with cosine error to improve alignment with recommendation tasks. Finally, we balance learning generation and preference to enhance the training stability of DMs. PreferDiff offers three key benefits: it is the first personalized ranking loss designed specifically for DM-based recommenders and it improves ranking and faster convergence by addressing hard negatives. We also prove that it is theoretically connected to Direct Preference Optimization which indicates that it has the potential to align user preferences in DM-based recommenders via generative modeling. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks validate its superior recommendation performance and commendable general sequential recommendation capabilities. Our codes are available at https://github.com/lswhim/PreferDiff.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, these approaches often overlook the critical role of user characteristics, which are essential in real-world scenarios like conversational search and recommendation, where interactions must adapt to individual user traits such as personality, preferences, and goals. To address this gap, we first conduct a comprehensive study utilizing task-specific user personas to systematically assess dialogue policy planning under diverse user behaviors. By leveraging realistic user profiles for different tasks, our study reveals significant limitations in existing approaches, highlighting the need for user-tailored dialogue policy planning. Building on this foundation, we present the User-Tailored Dialogue Policy Planning (UDP) framework, which incorporates an Intrinsic User World Model to model user traits and feedback. UDP operates in three stages: (1) User Persona Portraying, using a diffusion model to dynamically infer user profiles; (2) User Feedback Anticipating, leveraging a Brownian Bridge-inspired anticipator to predict user reactions; and (3) User-Tailored Policy Planning, integrating these insights to optimize response strategies. To ensure robust performance, we further propose an active learning approach that prioritizes challenging user personas during training. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks, including collaborative and non-collaborative settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of UDP in learning user-specific dialogue strategies. Results validate the protocol's utility and highlight UDP's robustness, adaptability, and potential to advance user-centric dialogue systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

However, the inherent noise contained in observed behaviors easily leads to suboptimal recommendation performance. Recently, the diffusion model's ability to generate information from noise presents a promising solution to this issue, prompting us to explore its application in multimedia recommendation. Nonetheless, several challenges must be addressed: 1) The diffusion model requires simplification to meet the efficiency requirements of real-time recommender systems, 2) The generated behaviors must align with user preference. To address these challenges, we propose a Light Diffusion model for Multimedia Recommendation (LD4MRec). LD4MRec largely reduces computational complexity by employing a forward-free inference strategy, which directly predicts future behaviors from observed noisy behaviors. Meanwhile, to ensure the alignment between generated behaviors and user preference, we propose a novel Conditional neural Network (C-Net). C-Net achieves guided generation by leveraging two key signals, collaborative signals and personalized modality preference signals, thereby improving the semantic consistency between generated behaviors and user preference. Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LD4MRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperbolic Diffusion Recommender Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01541v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as the new state-of-the-art family of deep generative models. To gain deeper insights into the limitations of diffusion models in recommender systems, we investigate the fundamental structural disparities between images and items. Consequently, items often exhibit distinct anisotropic and directional structures that are less prevalent in images. However, the traditional forward diffusion process continuously adds isotropic Gaussian noise, causing anisotropic signals to degrade into noise, which impairs the semantically meaningful representations in recommender systems. Inspired by the advancements in hyperbolic spaces, we propose a novel \textit{\textbf{H}yperbolic} \textit{\textbf{D}iffusion} \textit{\textbf{R}ecommender} \textit{\textbf{M}odel} (named HDRM). Unlike existing directional diffusion methods based on Euclidean space, the intrinsic non-Euclidean structure of hyperbolic space makes it particularly well-adapted for handling anisotropic diffusion processes. In particular, we begin by formulating concepts to characterize latent directed diffusion processes within a geometrically grounded hyperbolic space. Subsequently, we propose a novel hyperbolic latent diffusion process specifically tailored for users and items. Drawing upon the natural geometric attributes of hyperbolic spaces, we impose structural restrictions on the space to enhance hyperbolic diffusion propagation, thereby ensuring the preservation of the intrinsic topology of user-item graphs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HDRM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-based Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05029v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based recommendation methods have achieved impressive results. However, existing approaches predominantly treat each user's historical interactions as independent training samples, overlooking the potential of higher-order collaborative signals between users and items. Such signals, which encapsulate richer and more nuanced relationships, can be naturally captured using graph-based data structures. To address this limitation, we extend diffusion-based recommendation methods to the graph domain by directly modeling user-item bipartite graphs with diffusion models. This enables better modeling of the higher-order connectivity inherent in complex interaction dynamics. However, this extension introduces two primary challenges: (1) Noise Heterogeneity, where interactions are influenced by various forms of continuous and discrete noise, and (2) Relation Explosion, referring to the high computational costs of processing large-scale graphs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Graph-based Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering (GDMCF). To address noise heterogeneity, we introduce a multi-level noise corruption mechanism that integrates both continuous and discrete noise, effectively simulating real-world interaction complexities. To mitigate relation explosion, we design a user-active guided diffusion process that selectively focuses on the most meaningful edges and active users, reducing inference costs while preserving the graph's topological integrity. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GDMCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing higher-order collaborative signals and improving recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |

This study explores how algorithmically reinforced information cocooning shapes information diffusion and group emotional dynamics in online social networks. We propose a viewpoint-based network evolution model that simulates struc-tural transformations driven by user preferences. To model the hidden influence of personalized comment recommendations, we introduce the Hidden Comment Area Cocoon (H-CAC)-a novel higher-order structure that captures cocooning at the comment level. This structure is integrated into an emotion spreading mod-el, enabling the quantification of how cocooning affects collective sentiment. By defining Recommendation Accuracy (RA) as a tunable parameter, we systematically evaluate its impact on emo-tional volatility and polarization. Extensive simulations, validated with real-world data, reveal that while cocooning reduces content diversity, it can significantly enhance emotional resilience within groups. Our findings offer a new computational lens on the dual role of cocooning and provide actionable insights for designing emotionally stable, algorithmically governed social platforms.</p></details> |  |

However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by WWW2025</p></details> |

Recent advances in Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) have demonstrated promising potential to alleviate data sparsity issues by improving representation learning through contrastive view generation and mutual information maximization. However, existing approaches lack effective data augmentation strategies. Structural augmentation risks distorting fundamental graph topology, while feature-level perturbation techniques predominantly employ uniform noise scales that fail to account for node-specific characteristics. To solve these challenges, we propose Diffusion-augmented Contrastive Learning (DGCL), an innovative framework that integrates diffusion models with contrastive learning for enhanced collaborative filtering. Our approach employs a diffusion process that learns node-specific Gaussian distributions of representations, thereby generating semantically consistent yet diversified contrastive views through reverse diffusion sampling. DGCL facilitates adaptive data augmentation based on reconstructed representations, considering both semantic coherence and node-specific features. In addition, it explores unrepresented regions of the latent sparse feature space, thereby enriching the diversity of contrastive views. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DGCL on three public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Conditional Diffusion Models for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21967v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have shown promising results in sequential recommendation (SR). Existing approaches predominantly rely on implicit conditional diffusion models, which compress user behaviors into a single representation during the forward diffusion process. While effective to some extent, this oversimplification often leads to the loss of sequential and contextual information, which is critical for understanding user behavior. Moreover, explicit information, such as user-item interactions or sequential patterns, remains underutilized, despite its potential to directly guide the recommendation process and improve precision. However, combining implicit and explicit information is non-trivial, as it requires dynamically integrating these complementary signals while avoiding noise and irrelevant patterns within user behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose Dual Conditional Diffusion Models for Sequential Recommendation (DCRec), which effectively integrates implicit and explicit information by embedding dual conditions into both the forward and reverse diffusion processes. This allows the model to retain valuable sequential and contextual information while leveraging explicit user-item interactions to guide the recommendation process. Specifically, we introduce the Dual Conditional Diffusion Transformer (DCDT), which employs a cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate explicit signals throughout the diffusion stages, ensuring contextual understanding and minimizing the influence of irrelevant patterns. This design enables precise and contextually relevant recommendations. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DCRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoMerge: Towards Training-free Long Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09926v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video generation remains a challenging and compelling topic in computer vision. Diffusion based models, among the various approaches to video generation, have achieved state of the art quality with their iterative denoising procedures. However, the intrinsic complexity of the video domain renders the training of such diffusion models exceedingly expensive in terms of both data curation and computational resources. Moreover, these models typically operate on a fixed noise tensor that represents the video, resulting in predetermined spatial and temporal dimensions. Although several high quality open-source pretrained video diffusion models, jointly trained on images and videos of varying lengths and resolutions, are available, it is generally not recommended to specify a video length at inference that was not included in the training set. Consequently, these models are not readily adaptable to the direct generation of longer videos by merely increasing the specified video length. In addition to feasibility challenges, long-video generation also encounters quality issues. The domain of long videos is inherently more complex than that of short videos: extended durations introduce greater variability and necessitate long-range temporal consistency, thereby increasing the overall difficulty of the task. We propose VideoMerge, a training-free method that can be seamlessly adapted to merge short videos generated by pretrained text-to-video diffusion model. Our approach preserves the model's original expressiveness and consistency while allowing for extended duration and dynamic variation as specified by the user. By leveraging the strengths of pretrained models, our method addresses challenges related to smoothness, consistency, and dynamic content through orthogonal strategies that operate collaboratively to achieve superior quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-parametric kernel density estimation of magnitude distribution for the analysis of seismic hazard posed by anthropogenic seismicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04393v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frequent significant deviations of the observed magnitude distribution of anthropogenic seismicity from the Gutenberg-Richter relation require alternative estimation methods for probabilistic seismic hazard assessments. We evaluate five nonparametric kernel density estimation (KDE) methods on simulated samples drawn from four magnitude distribution models: the exponential, concave and convex bi-exponential, and exponential-Gaussian distributions. The latter three represent deviations from the Gutenberg-Richter relation due to the finite thickness of the seismogenic crust and the effect of characteristic earthquakes. The assumed deviations from exponentiality are never more than those met in practice. The studied KDE methods include Silverman's and Scott's rules with Abramson's bandwidth adaptation, two diffusion-based methods (ISJ and diffKDE), and adaptiveKDE, which formulates the bandwidth estimation as an optimization problem. We assess their performance for magnitudes from 2 to 6 with sample sizes of 400 to 5000, using the mean integrated square error (MISE) over 100,000 simulations. Their suitability in hazard assessments is illustrated by the mean of the mean return period (MRP) for a sample size of 1000. Among the tested methods, diffKDE provides the most accurate cumulative distribution function estimates for larger magnitudes. Even when the data is drawn from an exponential distribution, diffKDE performs comparably to maximum likelihood estimation when the sample size is at least 1000. Given that anthropogenic seismicity often deviates from the exponential model, we recommend using diffKDE for probabilistic seismic hazard assessments whenever a sufficient sample size is available.</p></details> | 26 pages, 15 figures |
| **[HI-Series Algorithms A Hybrid of Substance Diffusion Algorithm and Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01305v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems face the challenge of balancing accuracy and diversity, as traditional collaborative filtering (CF) and network-based diffusion algorithms exhibit complementary limitations. While item-based CF (ItemCF) enhances diversity through item similarity, it compromises accuracy. Conversely, mass diffusion (MD) algorithms prioritize accuracy by favoring popular items but lack diversity. To address this trade-off, we propose the HI-series algorithms, hybrid models integrating ItemCF with diffusion-based approaches (MD, HHP, BHC, BD) through a nonlinear combination controlled by parameter $ε$. This hybridization leverages ItemCF's diversity and MD's accuracy, extending to advanced diffusion models (HI-HHP, HI-BHC, HI-BD) for enhanced performance. Experiments on MovieLens, Netflix, and RYM datasets demonstrate that HI-series algorithms significantly outperform their base counterparts. In sparse data ($20\%$ training), HI-MD achieves a $0.8\%$-$4.4\%$ improvement in F1-score over MD while maintaining higher diversity (Diversity@20: 459 vs. 396 on MovieLens). For dense data ($80\%$ training), HI-BD improves F1-score by $2.3\%$-$5.2\%$ compared to BD, with diversity gains up to $18.6\%$. Notably, hybrid models consistently enhance novelty in sparse settings and exhibit robust parameter adaptability. The results validate that strategic hybridization effectively breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, offering a flexible framework for optimizing recommendation systems across data sparsity levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing Cold-start Problem in Click-Through Rate Prediction via Supervised Diffusion Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06270v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting Click-Through Rates is a crucial function within recommendation and advertising platforms, as the output of CTR prediction determines the order of items shown to users. The Embedding \& MLP paradigm has become a standard approach for industrial recommendation systems and has been widely deployed. However, this paradigm suffers from cold-start problems, where there is either no or only limited user action data available, leading to poorly learned ID embeddings. The cold-start problem hampers the performance of new items. To address this problem, we designed a novel diffusion model to generate a warmed-up embedding for new items. Specifically, we define a novel diffusion process between the ID embedding space and the side information space. In addition, we can derive a sub-sequence from the diffusion steps to expedite training, given that our diffusion model is non-Markovian. Our diffusion model is supervised by both the variational inference and binary cross-entropy objectives, enabling it to generate warmed-up embeddings for items in both the cold-start and warm-up phases. Additionally, we have conducted extensive experiments on three recommendation datasets. The results confirmed the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Two-Tower Models: Diffusion-Based Cross-Interaction for Large-Scale Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20687v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-tower models are widely adopted in the industrial-scale matching stage across a broad range of application domains, such as content recommendations, advertisement systems, and search engines. This model efficiently handles large-scale candidate item screening by separating user and item representations. However, the decoupling network also leads to a neglect of potential information interaction between the user and item representations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches include adding a shallow fully connected layer(i.e., COLD), which is limited by performance and can only be used in the ranking stage. For performance considerations, another approach attempts to capture historical positive interaction information from the other tower by regarding them as the input features(i.e., DAT). Later research showed that the gains achieved by this method are still limited because of lacking the guidance on the next user intent. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a "cross-interaction decoupling architecture" within our matching paradigm. This user-tower architecture leverages a diffusion module to reconstruct the next positive intention representation and employs a mixed-attention module to facilitate comprehensive cross-interaction. During the next positive intention generation, we further enhance the accuracy of its reconstruction by explicitly extracting the temporal drift within user behavior sequences. Experiments on two real-world datasets and one industrial dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the SOTA two-tower models significantly, and our diffusion approach outperforms other generative models in reconstructing item representations.</p></details> |  |

However, information propagation mechanisms, user behavior, and temporal activity patterns exhibit significant diversity, necessitating a foundational model capable of adapting to such variations. At the same time, the amount of available cascade data remains relatively limited compared to the vast datasets used for training large language models (LLMs). Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging LLMs for time-series prediction by exploiting commonalities across different time-series domains. Building on this insight, we introduce the Autoregressive Information Cascade Predictor (AutoCas), an LLM-enhanced model designed specifically for cascade popularity prediction. Unlike natural language sequences, cascade data is characterized by complex local topologies, diffusion contexts, and evolving dynamics, requiring specialized adaptations for effective LLM integration. To address these challenges, we first tokenize cascade data to align it with sequence modeling principles. Next, we reformulate cascade diffusion as an autoregressive modeling task to fully harness the architectural strengths of LLMs. Beyond conventional approaches, we further introduce prompt learning to enhance the synergy between LLMs and cascade prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AutoCas significantly outperforms baseline models in cascade popularity prediction while exhibiting scaling behavior inherited from LLMs. Code is available at this repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AutoCas-85C6</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, rumors of a "mysterious virus" had already been circulating in China in December 2019, possibly preceding the first confirmed COVID-19 case. Understanding how awareness about an emerging pandemic spreads through society is vital not only for enhancing disease surveillance, but also for mitigating demand shocks and social inequities, such as shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and essential supplies. Here we leverage a massive e-commerce dataset comprising 150 billion online queries and purchase records from 94 million people to detect the traces of early awareness and public response during the cryptic transmission period of COVID-19. Our analysis focuses on identifying information gaps across different demographic cohorts, revealing significant social inequities and the role of cultural factors in shaping awareness diffusion and response behaviors. By modeling awareness diffusion in heterogeneous social networks and analyzing online shopping behavior, we uncover the evolving characteristics of vulnerable populations. Our findings expand the theoretical understanding of awareness spread and social inequality in the early stages of a pandemic, highlighting the critical importance of e-commerce data and social network data in effectively and timely addressing future pandemic challenges. We also provide actionable recommendations to better manage and mitigate dynamic social inequalities in public health crises.</p></details> | <details><summary>It ha...</summary><p>It has been accepted by PNAS Nexus and will be available online as an open-access publication soon</p></details> |

We present ARM-Thinker, an A}gentic multimodal Reward Model that autonomously invokes external tools (e.g., image cropping, doc page retrieval) to ground judgments in verifiable evidence, replacing static, non-interactive reward scoring. This enables the model to verify fine-grained visual details, cross-reference multi-page evidence, and validate reasoning claims, which are capabilities absent in existing reward models. We train ARM-Thinker with multi-stage reinforcement learning, jointly optimizing tool-calling decisions and judgment accuracy. To evaluate agentic reward modeling, we introduce ARMBench-VL, comprising three benchmarks that assess fine-grained visual grounding (image-level tools), multi-page document understanding (retrieval tools), and instruction following (text-level verification). ARM-Thinker achieves +16.2% average improvement on reward modeling benchmarks, +9.6% on tool-use tasks, and outperforms baselines on multimodal math and logical reasoning benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that agentic capabilities significantly enhance both accuracy and interpretability of reward models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Athena: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning with Data-efficient Process Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09532v4)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems. Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data, we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios: verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios. Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score, showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with a significant margin on five benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAMEN: Resolution-Adjustable Multimodal Encoder for Earth Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05025v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Earth observation (EO) data spans a wide range of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, from high-resolution optical imagery to low resolution multispectral products or radar time series. While recent foundation models have improved multimodal integration for learning meaningful representations, they often expect fixed input resolutions or are based on sensor-specific encoders limiting generalization across heterogeneous EO modalities. To overcome these limitations we introduce RAMEN, a resolution-adjustable multimodal encoder that learns a shared visual representation across EO data in a fully sensor-agnostic manner. RAMEN treats the modality and spatial and temporal resolutions as key input data features, enabling coherent analysis across modalities within a unified latent space. Its main methodological contribution is to define spatial resolution as a controllable output parameter, giving users direct control over the desired level of detail at inference and allowing explicit trade-offs between spatial precision and computational cost. We train a single, unified transformer encoder reconstructing masked multimodal EO data drawn from diverse sources, ensuring generalization across sensors and resolutions. Once pretrained, RAMEN transfers effectively to both known and unseen sensor configurations and outperforms larger state-of-the-art models on the community-standard PANGAEA benchmark, containing various multi-sensor and multi-resolution downstream tasks. Our code and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/nicolashoudre/RAMEN.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress in structured generation in textual domain, there is still no benchmark that systematically evaluates schema-grounded information extraction and reasoning over visual inputs. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of visual structural output capabilities for MLLMs with our carefully designed SO-Bench benchmark. Covering four visual domains, including UI screens, natural images, documents, and charts, SO-Bench is built from over 6.5K diverse JSON schemas and 1.8K curated image-schema pairs with human-verified quality. Benchmarking experiments on open-sourced and frontier proprietary models reveal persistent gaps in predicting accurate, schema compliant outputs, highlighting the need for better multimodal structured reasoning. Beyond benchmarking, we further conduct training experiments to largely improve the model's structured output capability. We plan to make the benchmark available to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2 pr...</summary><p>v2 preprint.

However, acquiring CSI via pilot estimation incurs substantial overhead, especially in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in high-Doppler environments. By leveraging the growing availability of environmental sensing data, this treatise investigates pilot-free channel inference that estimates complete CSI directly from multimodal observations, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates. In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution. To make this formulation tractable and efficient, we reformulate the problem as an equivalent conditional flow matching objective and incorporate a modality alignment loss, while adopting low-latency inference mechanisms to enable real-time CSI estimation. In experiments, we build a procedural data generator based on Sionna and Blender to support realistic modeling of sensing scenes and wireless propagation. System-level evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over pilot- and sensing-based benchmarks in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency for the downstream beamforming task.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 13 figures, 40 references, submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Towards Adaptive Fusion of Multimodal Deep Networks for Human Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04943v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a pioneering methodology for human action recognition by harnessing deep neural network techniques and adaptive fusion strategies across multiple modalities, including RGB, optical flows, audio, and depth information. Employing gating mechanisms for multimodal fusion, we aim to surpass limitations inherent in traditional unimodal recognition methods while exploring novel possibilities for diverse applications. Through an exhaustive investigation of gating mechanisms and adaptive weighting-based fusion architectures, our methodology enables the selective integration of relevant information from various modalities, thereby bolstering both accuracy and robustness in action recognition tasks. We meticulously examine various gated fusion strategies to pinpoint the most effective approach for multimodal action recognition, showcasing its superiority over conventional unimodal methods. Gating mechanisms facilitate the extraction of pivotal features, resulting in a more holistic representation of actions and substantial enhancements in recognition performance. Our evaluations across human action recognition, violence action detection, and multiple self-supervised learning tasks on benchmark datasets demonstrate promising advancements in accuracy. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize action recognition systems across diverse fields. The fusion of multimodal information promises sophisticated applications in surveillance and human-computer interaction, especially in contexts related to active assisted living.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chameleon: Adaptive Adversarial Agents for Scaling-Based Visual Prompt Injection in Multimodal AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04895v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have become integral to critical applications ranging from autonomous decision-making to automated document processing. As these systems scale, they rely heavily on preprocessing pipelines to handle diverse inputs efficiently. However, this dependency on standard preprocessing operations, specifically image downscaling, creates a significant yet often overlooked security vulnerability. While intended for computational optimization, scaling algorithms can be exploited to conceal malicious visual prompts that are invisible to human observers but become active semantic instructions once processed by the model. Current adversarial strategies remain largely static, failing to account for the dynamic nature of modern agentic workflows. To address this gap, we propose Chameleon, a novel, adaptive adversarial framework designed to expose and exploit scaling vulnerabilities in production VLMs. Unlike traditional static attacks, Chameleon employs an iterative, agent-based optimization mechanism that dynamically refines image perturbations based on the target model's real-time feedback. This allows the framework to craft highly robust adversarial examples that survive standard downscaling operations to hijack downstream execution. We evaluate Chameleon against Gemini 2.5 Flash model. Our experiments demonstrate that Chameleon achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.5% across varying scaling factors, significantly outperforming static baseline attacks which average only 32.1%. Furthermore, we show that these attacks effectively compromise agentic pipelines, reducing decision-making accuracy by over 45% in multi-step tasks. Finally, we discuss the implications of these vulnerabilities and propose multi-scale consistency checks as a necessary defense mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing</p></details> |

However, a major challenge in developing generalized GUI agents is the lack of sufficient trajectory data across various operating systems and applications, mainly due to the high cost of manual annotations. In this paper, we propose the TongUI framework that builds generalized GUI agents by learning from rich multimodal web tutorials. Concretely, we crawl and process online GUI tutorials (such as videos and articles) into GUI agent trajectory data, through which we produce the GUI-Net dataset containing 143K trajectory data across five operating systems and more than 200 applications. We develop the TongUI agent by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B models on GUI-Net, which show remarkable performance improvements on commonly used grounding and navigation benchmarks, outperforming baseline agents about 10\% on multiple benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of the GUI-Net dataset and underscoring the significance of our TongUI framework. We will fully open-source the code, the GUI-Net dataset, and the trained models soon.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

Specifically, EMMA primarily consists of 1) An efficient autoencoder with a 32x compression ratio, which significantly reduces the number of tokens required for generation. This also ensures the training balance between understanding and generation tasks by applying the same compression ratio to images. 2) Channel-wise concatenation instead of token-wise concatenation among visual understanding and generation tokens, which further reduces the visual tokens in unified architectures. 3) A shared-and-decoupled network that enables mutual improvements across tasks while meeting the task-specific modeling requirements. 4) A mixture-of-experts mechanism adopted for visual understanding encoder, which substantially improves perceptual capabilities with a few parameters increase. Extensive experiments have shown that EMMA-4B can significantly outperform state-of-the-art unified multimodal approaches (e.g., BAGEL-7B) in both efficiency and performance, while also achieving competitive results compared to recent multimodal understanding and generation experts (e.g., Qwen3-VL and Qwen-Image). We believe that EMMA lays a solid foundation for the future development of unified multimodal architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://emma-umm.github.io/emma/</p></details> |

However, most existing systems still exhibit rigid reasoning behaviors, either overthinking simple problems or failing to reason when necessary. To address this limitation, we propose Omni-AutoThink, a novel adaptive reasoning framework that dynamically adjusts the model's reasoning depth according to task difficulty. Our framework comprises two stages: (1) an Adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning (Adaptive SFT) stage, which endows the Omni model with fundamental reasoning capability using large-scale reasoning-augmented data, and (2) an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (Adaptive GRPO) stage, which optimizes reasoning behaviors based on task complexity and reward feedback. We further construct a comprehensive adaptive reasoning benchmark that spans text-only, text-audio, text-visual, and text-audio-visual modalities, providing both training and evaluation splits for multimodal reasoning assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves adaptive reasoning performance compared to previous baselines. All benchmark data and code will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Adversarial Defense for Vision-Language Models by Leveraging One-To-Many Relationships](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18770v5)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language (VL) models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, existing defense methods primarily focus on image classification, overlooking two key aspects of VL tasks: multimodal attacks, where both image and text can be perturbed, and the one-to-many relationship of images and texts, where a single image can correspond to multiple textual descriptions and vice versa (1:N and N:1). This work is the first to explore defense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL defense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial training (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and text modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal defenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to enhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis shows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be well-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by prior research. This work pioneers defense strategies against multimodal attacks, providing insights for building robust VLMs from both optimization and data perspectives.

Unlike existing holistic approaches that rely on an element-by-attribute grid representation, our representation accommodates variable-length elements, type-dependent attributes, and text content. Inspired by fill-in-the-middle training in code generation, we train the model to complete the missing part of a design document from its surrounding context, allowing it to treat various design tasks in a unified manner. Our model also supports image generation by predicting discrete image tokens through a specialized tokenizer with support for image transparency. We evaluate MarkupDM on three tasks, attribute value, image, and text completion, and demonstrate that it can produce plausible designs consistent with the given context. To further illustrate the flexibility of our approach, we evaluate our approach on a new instruction-guided design completion task where our instruction-tuned MarkupDM compares favorably to state-of-the-art image editing models, especially in textual completion. These findings suggest that multimodal language models with our document representation can serve as a versatile foundation for broad design automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025, Project page: https://cyberagentailab.github.io/MarkupDM/</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of MLLMs' ability to identify and correct these video reasoning errors. To bridge this gap, we propose ViRectify, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their fine-grained correction capability. Through an AI-assisted annotation pipeline with human verification, we construct a dataset of over 30K instances spanning dynamic perception, scientific reasoning, and embodied decision-making domains. In ViRectify, we challenge MLLMs to perform step-wise error identification and generate rationales with key video evidence grounding. In addition, we further propose the trajectory evidence-driven correction framework, comprising step-wise error trajectory and reward modeling on visual evidence-grounded correction. It encourages the model to explicitly concentrate on error propagation and key timestamps for correction. Extensive evaluation across 16 advanced MLLMs demonstrates that our ViRectify serves as a challenging testbed, where GPT-5 achieves only 31.94% correction accuracy. Our framework enables a Qwen2.5-VL-7B to consistently outperform the variants of 72B on ViRectify, showing the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis uncovers systematic asymmetries in error correction across models, and our dataset is also a valuable data resource to perform reflection learning. We believe ViRectify provides a new direction for comprehensively evaluating the advanced MLLMs in video reasoning.</p></details> | 22 pages, 11 figures |

Existing approaches largely reduce it to text only summarization, overlooking the visual component and design intensive nature of slide creation. In this paper we introduce SlideGen, an agentic, modular, and visual in the loop framework for scientific paper to slide generation. SlideGen orchestrates a group of vision language agents that reason collaboratively over the document structure and semantics, producing editable PPTX slides with logical flow and compelling visual presentation. By integrating coordinated outlining, mapping, arrangement, note synthesis, and iterative refinement, our system consistently delivers slides of expert level quality. Across diverse benchmarks and strong baselines, SlideGen outperforms existing methods in visual quality, content faithfulness, and readability, positioning it as the new state of the art in automated slide generation. Our work establishes a foundation for design aware multimodal slide generation, demonstrating how agentic collaboration can bridge understanding and presentation in complex multimodal reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[BiTAgent: A Task-Aware Modular Framework for Bidirectional Coupling between Multimodal Large Language Models and World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04513v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building generalist embodied agents requires a unified system that can interpret multimodal goals, model environment dynamics, and execute reliable actions across diverse real-world tasks. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction. Extensive experiments across multi-task and cross-environment settings demonstrate superior stability and generalization over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a step toward open-ended embodied learning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space. Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE, achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages,13 figures,9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Explainable Parkinsons Disease Gait Recognition Using Multimodal RGB-D Fusion and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04425v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and interpretable gait analysis plays a crucial role in the early detection of Parkinsons disease (PD),yet most existing approaches remain limited by single-modality inputs, low robustness, and a lack of clinical transparency. This paper presents an explainable multimodal framework that integrates RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data to recognize Parkinsonian gait patterns under realistic conditions. The proposed system employs dual YOLOv11-based encoders for modality-specific feature extraction, followed by a Multi-Scale Local-Global Extraction (MLGE) module and a Cross-Spatial Neck Fusion mechanism to enhance spatial-temporal representation. This design captures both fine-grained limb motion (e.g., reduced arm swing) and overall gait dynamics (e.g., short stride or turning difficulty), even in challenging scenarios such as low lighting or occlusion caused by clothing. To ensure interpretability, a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) is incorporated to translate fused visual embeddings and structured metadata into clinically meaningful textual explanations. Experimental evaluations on multimodal gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D fusion framework achieves higher recognition accuracy, improved robustness to environmental variations, and clear visual-linguistic reasoning compared with single-input baselines. By combining multimodal feature learning with language-based interpretability, this study bridges the gap between visual recognition and clinical understanding, offering a novel vision-language paradigm for reliable and explainable Parkinsons disease gait analysis.

| **[Dual-branch Prompting for Multimodal Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17588v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) typically enhances text-only translation by incorporating aligned visual features. Despite the remarkable progress, state-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at inference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their robustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose D2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust vision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text and a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which naturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic cues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and reconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich cross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate training-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss that enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches. Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under review at the ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Object and Action Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04356v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancement in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) has demonstrated their remarkable capability to generate descriptive captions for input videos. However, these models suffer from factual inaccuracies in the generated descriptions, causing severe hallucination issues. While prior works have explored alleviating hallucinations for static images, jointly mitigating visual object and temporal action hallucinations for dynamic videos remains a challenging and unsolved task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework for enabling object and action faithfulness by exempting the spurious correlations and enforcing the emphasis on visual facts. SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives. Furthermore, we develop a tracklet-phrase contrastive alignment to match the regional objects and relation-guided actions with their corresponding visual and temporal phrases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SANTA outperforms existing methods in alleviating object and action hallucinations, yielding superior performance on the hallucination examination benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2026.

However, existing datasets are often derived from limited simulators or utilize traditional Structurefrom-Motion for up-to-scale annotation and offer limited descriptive captioning, which restricts the capacity of foundation models to accurately interpret real-world dynamics from monocular videos, commonly sourced from the internet. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DynamicVerse, a physical-scale, multimodal 4D world modeling framework for dynamic real-world video. We employ large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to interpret metric-scale static geometry, real-world dynamic motion, instance-level masks, and holistic descriptive captions. By integrating window-based Bundle Adjustment with global optimization, our method converts long real-world video sequences into a comprehensive 4D multimodal format. DynamicVerse delivers a large-scale dataset consisting of 100K+ videos with 800K+ annotated masks and 10M+ frames from internet videos. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark tasks, namely video depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and camera intrinsics estimation, demonstrate that our 4D modeling achieves superior performance in capturing physical-scale measurements with greater global accuracy than existing methods.</p></details> |  |

The development and validation of reliable cardiovascular monitoring algorithms for these consumer-grade devices requires realistic biosignal data from diverse sets of participants. However, the availability of public consumer-grade smartwatch datasets with synchronized cardiovascular biosignals is limited, and existing datasets do not offer rich demographic diversity in their participant cohorts, leading to potentially biased algorithm development. This paper presents HEART-Watch, a multimodal physiological dataset collected from temporally synchronized wrist-worn Google Pixel Watch 2 electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmography, and accelerometer signals from a diverse cohort of 40 healthy adults across three physical states - sitting, standing and walking with reference chest ECG. Intermittent upper arm blood pressure measurements and concurrent biosignals were collected as an additional biomarker for future research. The motivation, methodology, and initial analyses of results are presented. HEART-Watch is intended to support the development and benchmarking of robust algorithms for cardiovascular analyses on consumer-grade smartwatches across diverse populations.</p></details> |  |

However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis of Image-Text Pairs by Distribution-Based Feature Recovery and Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18751v3)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As posts on social media increase rapidly, analyzing the sentiments embedded in image-text pairs has become a popular research topic in recent years. Although existing works achieve impressive accomplishments in simultaneously harnessing image and text information, they lack the considerations of possible low-quality and missing modalities. In real-world applications, these issues might frequently occur, leading to urgent needs for models capable of predicting sentiment robustly. Therefore, we propose a Distribution-based feature Recovery and Fusion (DRF) method for robust multimodal sentiment analysis of image-text pairs. Specifically, we maintain a feature queue for each modality to approximate their feature distributions, through which we can simultaneously handle low-quality and missing modalities in a unified framework. For low-quality modalities, we reduce their contributions to the fusion by quantitatively estimating modality qualities based on the distributions. For missing modalities, we build inter-modal mapping relationships supervised by samples and distributions, thereby recovering the missing modalities from available ones. In experiments, two disruption strategies that corrupt and discard some modalities in samples are adopted to mimic the low-quality and missing modalities in various real-world scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments on three publicly available image-text datasets, we demonstrate the universal improvements of DRF compared to SOTA methods under both two strategies, validating its effectiveness in robust multimodal sentiment analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024</p></details> |

This leaves broader training scenarios and resources underexplored, limiting the exploration and learning of Vision Language Models (VLMs) through RL. We find video games inherently provide rich visual elements and mechanics that are easy to verify. To fully use the multimodal and verifiable reward in video games, we propose Game-RL, constructing diverse game tasks for RL training to boost VLMs general reasoning ability. To obtain training data, we propose Code2Logic, a novel approach that adapts game code to synthesize game reasoning task data, thus obtaining the GameQA dataset of 30 games and 158 tasks with controllable difficulty gradation. Unexpectedly, RL training solely on GameQA enables multiple VLMs to achieve performance improvements across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating the value of Game-RL for enhancing VLMs' general reasoning. Furthermore, this suggests that video games may serve as valuable scenarios and resources to boost general reasoning abilities.

We begin by constructing ColonVQA, the most comprehensive multimodal dataset ever built for colonoscopy, featuring over 1.1M+ visual question answering entries across 76 clinical findings and 18 multimodal tasks. Beyond serving as a community-wide data foundation, we further investigate a critical yet underexplored transition in colonoscopy - evolving from multimodal understanding to clinical reasoning: (a) To capture the current landscape of multimodal understanding behaviors, we systematically assess the generalizability of 22 multimodal large language models and examine their reliability under human-induced perturbations. The results reveal that clinical outputs from leading MLLMs remain far from robust and trustworthy. (b) To narrow this gap, we further explore reasoning-centric intelligence tailored for colonoscopy. Specifically, we curate ColonReason, a clinically grounded reasoning dataset annotated through a multi-expert debating pipeline, and develop ColonR1, the first R1-styled model incorporating task-adaptive rewarding and gradient-stable optimization techniques. Under data-scarce conditions, our ColonR1 achieves 56.61% overall accuracy, outperforming supervised fine-tuning by 25.22%, and sets a new reasoning-enabled baseline for multimodal colonoscopy analysis.

Without reliable memory, agents catastrophically forget past experiences, struggle with long-horizon reasoning, and fail to operate coherently in multimodal or interactive environments. We introduce MemVerse, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play memory framework that bridges fast parametric recall with hierarchical retrieval-based memory, enabling scalable and adaptive multimodal intelligence. MemVerse maintains short-term memory for recent context while transforming raw multimodal experiences into structured long-term memories organized as hierarchical knowledge graphs. This design supports continual consolidation, adaptive forgetting, and bounded memory growth. To handle real-time demands, MemVerse introduces a periodic distillation mechanism that compresses essential knowledge from long-term memory into the parametric model, allowing fast, differentiable recall while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MemVerse significantly improves multimodal reasoning and continual learning efficiency, empowering agents to remember, adapt, and reason coherently across extended interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

To this end, we propose a new multimodal agent framework, Vision-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Framework (VICoT), which implements explicit multi-round reasoning by dynamically incorporating visual tools into the chain of thought. Through a stack-based reasoning structure and a modular MCP-compatible tool suite, VICoT enables LLMs to efficiently perform multi-round, interleaved vision-language reasoning tasks with strong generalization and flexibility.We also propose the Reasoning Stack distillation method to migrate complex Agent behaviors to small, lightweight models, which ensures the reasoning capability while significantly reducing complexity. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate that VICoT significantly outperforms existing SOTA frameworks in reasoning transparency, execution efficiency, and generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLSU: Mapping the Limits of Joint Multimodal Understanding for AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18214v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns. Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories. Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to 53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, detailed appendix.

However, this integration also introduces new vulnerabilities, making MLLMs susceptible to multimodal jailbreak attacks and hindering their safe deployment.Existing defense methods, including Image-to-Text Translation, Safe Prompting, and Multimodal Safety Tuning, attempt to address this by aligning multimodal inputs with LLMs' built-in safeguards.Yet, they fall short in uncovering root causes of multimodal vulnerabilities, particularly how harmful multimodal tokens trigger jailbreak in MLLMs? Consequently, they remain vulnerable to text-driven multimodal jailbreaks, often exhibiting overdefensive behaviors and imposing heavy training overhead.To bridge this gap, we present an comprehensive analysis of where, how and which harmful multimodal tokens bypass safeguards in MLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that less than 1% tokens in early-middle layers are responsible for inducing unsafe behaviors, highlighting the potential of precisely removing a small subset of harmful tokens, without requiring safety tuning, can still effectively improve safety against jailbreaks. Motivated by this, we propose Safe Prune-then-Restore (SafePTR), an training-free defense framework that selectively prunes harmful tokens at vulnerable layers while restoring benign features at subsequent layers.Without incurring additional computational overhead, SafePTR significantly enhances the safety of MLLMs while preserving efficiency. Extensive evaluations across three MLLMs and five benchmarks demonstrate SafePTR's state-of-the-art performance in mitigating jailbreak risks without compromising utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

This issue stems from a fundamental problem of visual neglect, where models fail to adequately prioritize input images. Existing methods typically alleviate hallucinations by intervening in the attention score or output logits, focusing on "how to intervene" but overlooking the prerequisite "when to intervene", which leads to the "over-intervention" problem and subsequently introduces new hallucinations and unnecessary computational overhead. To address this gap, we first investigate the mechanism of visual neglect and reveal it can be accurately detected via head-level activation patterns in MLLMs. We thus propose V-ITI, a lightweight visual inference-time intervention framework integrating a Visual Neglect Detector that identifies visual neglect via head-level discriminative probes and a Visual Recall Intervenor that modulates activations with prestored visual activation information only when the visual neglect is detected. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks and different MLLM families demonstrate that V-ITI consistently mitigates vision-related hallucinations while preserving general task performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches either struggle to capture complex cross-modal interactions or experience gradient conflicts and unstable training when using deeper architectures. To address these issues, we propose Cross-Space Synergy (CSS), which couples a representation component with an optimization component. Synergistic Polynomial Fusion (SPF) serves the representation role, leveraging low-rank tensor factorization to efficiently capture high-order cross-modal interactions. Pareto Gradient Modulator (PGM) serves the optimization role, steering updates along Pareto-optimal directions across competing objectives to alleviate gradient conflicts and improve stability. Experiments show that CSS outperforms existing representative methods on IEMOCAP and MELD in both accuracy and training stability, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex multimodal scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches remain heavily English-centric, limiting their effectiveness in multilingual contexts. In this work, we present M3DR (Multilingual Multimodal Document Retrieval), a framework designed to bridge this gap across languages, enabling applicability across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. M3DR leverages synthetic multilingual document data and generalizes across different vision-language architectures and model sizes, enabling robust cross-lingual and cross-modal alignment. Using contrastive training, our models learn unified representations for text and document images that transfer effectively across languages. We validate this capability on 22 typologically diverse languages, demonstrating consistent performance and adaptability across linguistic and script variations. We further introduce a comprehensive benchmark that captures real-world multilingual scenarios, evaluating models under monolingual, multilingual, and mixed-language settings. M3DR generalizes across both single dense vector and ColBERT-style token-level multi-vector retrieval paradigms. Our models, NetraEmbed and ColNetraEmbed achieve state-of-the-art performance with ~150% relative improvements on cross-lingual retrieval.</p></details> |  |

Recently, in the multimodal domain, works have begun to directly apply RL to generate R1-like free-form reasoning for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. However, multimodal tasks share an intrinsically different nature from textual tasks, which heavily rely on the understanding of the input image to solve the problem. Therefore, such free-form reasoning faces two critical limitations in the VQA task: (1) Extended reasoning chains diffuse visual focus away from task-critical regions, degrading answer accuracy. (2) Unverifiable intermediate steps amplify policy-gradient variance and computational costs overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce SATORI ($\textbf{S}patially$ $\textbf{A}nchored$ $\textbf{T}ask$ $\textbf{O}ptimization$ with $\textbf{R}e\textbf{I}nforcement$ Learning), which decomposes VQA into three verifiable stages, including global image captioning, region localization, and answer prediction, each supplying explicit reward signals. Furthermore, we also introduce VQA-Verify, a 12k dataset annotated with answer-aligned captions and bounding-boxes to facilitate training. Experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements across seven VQA benchmarks, achieving up to $15.7\%$ improvement in accuracy in accuracy compared to the R1-like baseline. Our analysis of the attention map confirms enhanced focus on critical regions, which brings improvements in accuracy.

In real-world scenarios, deepfake content can manifest across multiple modalities, including audio and video. To address this challenge, we present ERF-BA-TFD+, a novel multimodal deepfake detection model that combines enhanced receptive field (ERF) and audio-visual fusion. Our model processes both audio and video features simultaneously, leveraging their complementary information to improve detection accuracy and robustness. The key innovation of ERF-BA-TFD+ lies in its ability to model long-range dependencies within the audio-visual input, allowing it to better capture subtle discrepancies between real and fake content. In our experiments, we evaluate ERF-BA-TFD+ on the DDL-AV dataset, which consists of both segmented and full-length video clips. Unlike previous benchmarks, which focused primarily on isolated segments, the DDL-AV dataset allows us to assess the model's performance in a more comprehensive and realistic setting. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this dataset, outperforming existing techniques in terms of both accuracy and processing speed. The ERF-BA-TFD+ model demonstrated its effectiveness in the "Workshop on Deepfake Detection, Localization, and Interpretability," Track 2: Audio-Visual Detection and Localization (DDL-AV), and won first place in this competition.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is withdrawn after discovering a flaw in the theoretical derivation presented in Section Method.

Despite these advancements, there is a lack of the robust benchmark specifically for assessing the Image-to-Web conversion proficiency of these large models. Primarily, it is essential to ensure the integrity of the web elements generated. These elements comprise visible and invisible categories. Previous evaluation methods (e.g.,BLEU) are notably susceptible to significant alterations due to the presence of invisible elements in Web. Furthermore, it is crucial to measure the layout information of web pages, referring to the positional relationships between elements, which is overlooked by previous work. To address challenges, we have curated and aligned a benchmark of images and corresponding web codes (IW-BENCH). Specifically, we propose the Element Accuracy, which tests the completeness of the elements by parsing the Document Object Model (DOM) tree. Layout Accuracy is also proposed to analyze the positional relationships of elements by converting DOM tree into a common subsequence. Besides, we design a five-hop multimodal Chain-of-Thought Prompting for better performance, which contains five hop: 1) SoM prompt injection. 2) Inferring Elements. 3) Inferring Layout. 4) Inferring Web code. 5) Reflection. Our benchmark comprises 1200 pairs of images and web codes with varying levels of difficulty. We have conducted extensive experiments on existing large multimodal models, offering insights into their performance and areas for improvement in image-to-web domain.</p></details> |  |

Existing visual grounding (VG) methods for autonomous vehicles (AVs) typically struggle with ambiguous, context-dependent instructions, as they lack reasoning over 3D spatial relations and anticipated scene evolution. Grounded in the principles of world models, we propose ThinkDeeper, a framework that reasons about future spatial states before making grounding decisions. At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation. Complementing this, a hypergraph-guided decoder then hierarchically fuses these states with the multimodal input, capturing higher-order spatial dependencies for robust localization. In addition, we present DrivePilot, a multi-source VG dataset in AD, featuring semantic annotations generated by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-prompted LLM pipeline. Extensive evaluations on six benchmarks, ThinkDeeper ranks #1 on the Talk2Car leaderboard and surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on DrivePilot, MoCAD, and RefCOCO/+/g benchmarks. Notably, it shows strong robustness and efficiency in challenging scenes (long-text, multi-agent, ambiguity) and retains superior performance even when trained on 50% of the data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Reinforcement Learning with Agentic Verifier for AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03438v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic reasoning models trained with multimodal reinforcement learning (MMRL) have become increasingly capable, yet they are almost universally optimized using sparse, outcome-based rewards computed based on the final answers. Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL. Finally, we also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of Argos through the concept of pareto-optimality.</p></details> |  |

We identify the attack surface where an adversary can cheaply automate CAPTCHA solving using off-the-shelf models. We evaluate 7 leading commercial and open-source MLLMs across 18 real-world CAPTCHA task types, measuring single-shot accuracy, success under limited retries, end-to-end latency, and per-solve cost. We further analyze the impact of task-specific prompt engineering and few-shot demonstrations on solver effectiveness. We reveal that MLLMs can reliably solve recognition-oriented and low-interaction CAPTCHA tasks at human-like cost and latency, whereas tasks requiring fine-grained localization, multi-step spatial reasoning, or cross-frame consistency remain significantly harder for current models. By examining the reasoning traces of such MLLMs, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of why models succeed/fail on specific CAPTCHA puzzles and use these insights to derive defense-oriented guidelines for selecting and strengthening CAPTCHA tasks. We conclude by discussing implications for platform operators deploying CAPTCHA as part of their abuse-mitigation pipeline.Code Availability (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Captcha-465E/).</p></details> |  |

While generative models have shown promise in data augmentation, existing approaches are limited to single modalities and fail to capture cross-domain dependencies. This paper introduces MAGE-ID (Multimodal Attack Generator for Intrusion Detection), a diffusion-based generative framework that couples tabular flow features with their transformed images through a unified latent prior. By jointly training Transformer and CNN-based variational encoders with an EDM style denoiser, MAGE-ID achieves balanced and coherent multimodal synthesis. Evaluations on CIC-IDS-2017 and NSL-KDD demonstrate significant improvements in fidelity, diversity, and downstream detection performance over TabSyn and TabDDPM, highlighting the effectiveness of MAGE-ID for multimodal IDS augmentation.</p></details> |  |

We present a framework that combines upside-down reinforcement learning with synthetic data distillation from a large language model (Llama-3) to train a 100M-parameter GPT-2 model for multitask prompt generation. Despite being up to 80 times smaller than state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), our SLM achieves relevance and diversity scores within 6% of competitive baselines such as Llama-3 8B, Qwen3 8B, and Ministral 8B. These results demonstrate that SLMs can effectively handle multimodal search and recommendation tasks, while dramatically reducing inference latency and memory overhead. Our study highlights the potential of lightweight models as practical engines for scalable multimodal discovery, bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world multimodal applications such as media recommendations and creative content generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025 MMSR</p></details> |

To rigorously study this, we introduce MMA-Bench comprising videos and tasks that probe a model's reliance on specific modalities. Using black-box and white-box interpretability techniques, we provide a critical analysis of the brittleness of both open- and closed-sourced MLLMs. We show that current MLLMs struggle under misaligned audio-visual pairs and simple misleading text, thereby lacking robust multi-modal reasoning. Building on these findings, we propose a modality alignment tuning strategy to teach the model when to prioritize, leverage, or ignore specific modality cues. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that our alignment tuning yields demonstrably stronger multimodal grounding. This work provides both interpretability tools and a clear path toward developing MLLMs with intrinsically reliable cross-modal reasoning. Code and dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Too Late to Recall: Explaining the Two-Hop Problem in Multimodal Knowledge Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03276v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training vision language models (VLMs) aims to align visual representations from a vision encoder with the textual representations of a pretrained large language model (LLM). However, many VLMs exhibit reduced factual recall performance compared to their LLM backbones, raising the question of how effective multimodal fine-tuning is at extending existing mechanisms within the LLM to visual inputs. We argue that factual recall based on visual inputs requires VLMs to solve a two-hop problem: (1) forming entity representations from visual inputs, and (2) recalling associated factual knowledge based on these entity representations. By benchmarking 14 VLMs with various architectures (LLaVA, Native, Cross-Attention), sizes (7B-124B parameters), and training setups on factual recall tasks against their original LLM backbone models, we find that 11 of 14 models exhibit factual recall degradation. We select three models with high and two models with low performance degradation, and use attribution patching, activation patching, and probing to show that degraded VLMs struggle to use the existing factual recall circuit of their LLM backbone, because they resolve the first hop too late in the computation. In contrast, high-performing VLMs resolve entity representations early enough to reuse the existing factual recall mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate two methods to recover performance: patching entity representations from the LLM backbone into the VLM, and prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning. Our results highlight that the speed of early entity resolution critically determines how effective VLMs are in using preexisting LLM mechanisms. More broadly, our work illustrates how mechanistic analysis can explain and unveil systematic failures in multimodal alignment.</p></details> |  |

However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project website is https://carlyx.github.io/MAViD/</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Intra- and Inter-modal Forgetting in Continual Learning of Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03125v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Multimodal Generative Models (UMGMs) unify visual understanding and image generation within a single autoregressive framework. However, their ability to continually learn new tasks is severely hindered by catastrophic forgetting, both within a modality (intra-modal) and across modalities (inter-modal). While intra-modal forgetting has been studied in prior continual learning (CL) work, inter-modal forgetting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify and empirically validate this phenomenon in UMGMs and provide a theoretical explanation rooted in gradient conflict between modalities. To address both intra- and inter-modal forgetting, we propose Modality-Decoupled Experts (MoDE), a lightweight and scalable architecture that isolates modality-specific updates to mitigate the gradient conflict and leverages knowledge distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting and preserve pre-trained capabilities. Unlike previous CL methods that remain modality-coupled and suffer from modality gradient conflict, MoDE explicitly decouples modalities to prevent interference. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoDE significantly mitigates both inter- and intra-modal forgetting, outperforming prior CL baselines in unified multimodal generation settings. Codes will be publicly available: https://github.com/Christina200/MoDE-official.git</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\% and 91.07\%. Our method significantly outperforms prior work, demonstrating that the visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Multimodal Embeddings for Traffic Accident Prediction and Causal Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02920v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages.

However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach, achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively, across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up, which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing, while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer. Our results demonstrate that multimodal single-frame action anticipation using AAG can perform competitively compared to both temporally aggregated video baselines and state-of-the-art methods across three instructional activity datasets: IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in WACV 2026 - Applications Track</p></details> |

Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering. We release our Slide Translation code at https://github.com/saikoneru/image-translator and integrate it in Lecture Translator at https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/isl-ai4lt/lt-middleware/ltpipeline}\footnote{All released code and models are licensed under the MIT License.</p></details> | Under review |

Consequently, understanding training-data leakage in these systems is increasingly critical. Log-probability-based membership inference attacks (MIAs) have become a widely adopted approach for assessing data exposure in large language models (LLMs), yet their effect in MLLMs remains unclear. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of extending these text-based MIA methods to multimodal settings. Our experiments under vision-and-text (V+T) and text-only (T-only) conditions across the DeepSeek-VL and InternVL model families show that in in-distribution settings, logit-based MIAs perform comparably across configurations, with a slight V+T advantage. Conversely, in out-of-distribution settings, visual inputs act as regularizers, effectively masking membership signals.</p></details> |  |

Existing learning based approaches struggle to capture rare but safety critical behaviors, while rule based systems often lack adaptability in complex interactions. To address these limitations, CogDrive introduces a cognition driven multimodal prediction and planning framework that integrates explicit modal reasoning with safety aware trajectory optimization. The prediction module adopts cognitive representations of interaction modes based on topological motion semantics and nearest neighbor relational encoding. With a differentiable modal loss and multimodal Gaussian decoding, CogDrive learns sparse and unbalanced interaction behaviors and improves long horizon trajectory prediction. The planning module incorporates an emergency response concept and optimizes safety stabilized trajectories, where short term consistent branches ensure safety during replanning cycles and long term branches support smooth and collision free motion under low probability switching modes. Experiments on Argoverse2 and INTERACTION datasets show that CogDrive achieves strong performance in trajectory accuracy and miss rate, while closed loop simulations confirm adaptive behavior in merge and intersection scenarios. By combining cognitive multimodal prediction with safety oriented planning, CogDrive offers an interpretable and reliable paradigm for safe autonomy in complex traffic.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.</p></details> |  |

Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

However, a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration is still lacking. Existing approaches have primarily focused on independent models for individual tasks, often overlooking the potential for cross-modal information sharing. Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios. Experimental results show that UAUTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains a favourable trade-off between accuracy and speed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset, demonstrating both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In the context of education, these technologies offer new opportunities to study cognitive and affective processes such as engagement, attention, and performance. However, the lack of scalable, synchronized, and high-resolution tools for multimodal data acquisition continues to be a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Multimodal Learning Analytics in real-world educational settings. This paper presents two complementary tools developed to address these challenges: Watch-DMLT, a data acquisition application for Fitbit Sense 2 smartwatches that enables real-time, multi-user monitoring of physiological and motion signals; and ViSeDOPS, a dashboard-based visualization system for analyzing synchronized multimodal data collected during oral presentations. We report on a classroom deployment involving 65 students and up to 16 smartwatches, where data streams including heart rate, motion, gaze, video, and contextual annotations were captured and analyzed.

Recent Transformer-based methods like BERT4Rec have shown strong modeling capability, yet they still rely on discrete item IDs that lack semantic meaning and ignore rich multimodal information (e.g., text and image). This leads to weak generalization and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Bert4Rec, a multimodal sequential recommendation framework that unifies semantic representation and quantized modeling. Specifically, Q-Bert4Rec consists of three stages: (1) cross-modal semantic injection, which enriches randomly initialized ID embeddings through a dynamic transformer that fuses textual, visual, and structural features; (2) semantic quantization, which discretizes fused representations into meaningful tokens via residual vector quantization; and (3) multi-mask pretraining and fine-tuning, which leverage diverse masking strategies -- span, tail, and multi-region -- to improve sequential understanding. We validate our model on public Amazon benchmarks and demonstrate that Q-Bert4Rec significantly outperforms many strong existing methods, confirming the effectiveness of semantic tokenization for multimodal sequential recommendation. Our source code will be publicly available on GitHub after publishing.</p></details> | Submitted to KDD2026 |

MLLMs deployed on devices have to continuously adapt to dynamic scenarios in downstream tasks, such as variations in background and perspective, to effectively perform complex visual tasks. To this end, we construct a multimodal visual understanding dataset (MSVQA) encompassing four different scenarios and perspectives including high altitude, underwater, low altitude and indoor, to investigate the catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs under the dynamics of scenario shifts in real-world data streams. Furthermore, we propose mUltimodal coNtInual learning with MLLMs From multi-scenarIo pERspectives (UNIFIER) to address visual discrepancies while learning different scenarios. Specifically, it decouples the visual information from different scenarios into distinct branches within each vision block and projects them into the same feature space. A consistency constraint is imposed on the features of each branch to maintain the stability of visual representations across scenarios. Extensive experiments on the MSVQA dataset demonstrate that UNIFIER effectively alleviates forgetting of cross-scenario tasks and achieves knowledge accumulation within the same scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 16 figures.

However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Winte...</summary><p>Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision 2026</p></details> |

However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page : https://worldmm.github.io</p></details> |

Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations.</p></details> |  |

However, atomicity violations have become a potential security risk. Existing analysis tools often lack the precision required to detect these issues effectively. To address this challenge, we introduce AtomGraph, an automated framework designed for detecting atomicity violations. This framework leverages Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to identify atomicity violations through multimodal feature learning and fusion. Specifically, driven by a collaborative learning mechanism, the model simultaneously learns from two heterogeneous modalities: extracting structural topological features from the contract's Control Flow Graph (CFG) and uncovering deep semantics from its opcode sequence. We designed an adaptive weighted fusion mechanism to dynamically adjust the weights of features from each modality to achieve optimal feature fusion. Finally, GCN detects graph-level atomicity violation on the contract. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that AtomGraph achieves 96.88% accuracy and 96.97% F1 score, outperforming existing tools. Furthermore, compared to the concatenation fusion model, AtomGraph improves the F1 score by 6.4%, proving its potential in smart contract security detection.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics.

This review visits foundational concepts such as the distributional hypothesis and contextual similarity, tracing the evolution from sparse representations like one-hot encoding to dense embeddings including Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText. We examine both static and contextualized embeddings, underscoring advancements in models such as ELMo, BERT, and GPT and their adaptations for cross-lingual and personalized applications. The discussion extends to sentence and document embeddings, covering aggregation methods and generative topic models, along with the application of embeddings in multimodal domains, including vision, robotics, and cognitive science. Advanced topics such as model compression, interpretability, numerical encoding, and bias mitigation are analyzed, addressing both technical challenges and ethical implications. Additionally, we identify future research directions, emphasizing the need for scalable training techniques, enhanced interpretability, and robust grounding in non-textual modalities. By synthesizing current methodologies and emerging trends, this survey offers researchers and practitioners an in-depth resource to push the boundaries of embedding-based language models.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Understanding and Harnessing Sparsity in Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02351v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in both understanding and generation. Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters. The code is released at \href{https://github.com/Shwai-He/SparseUnifiedModel}{this link}.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

We build the first robustness benchmark for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted, lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger defences.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figure |

Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Tiny but Mighty: A Software-Hardware Co-Design Approach for Efficient Multimodal Inference on Battery-Powered Small Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05109v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are inherently modular, consisting of vision and audio encoders, projectors, and large language models. Yet, they are almost always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units. It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy consumption by 42.3\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\%. This enables a battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly 20.8 hours.</p></details> |  |

We present TUNA, a native UMM that builds a unified continuous visual representation by cascading a VAE encoder with a representation encoder. This unified representation space allows end-to-end processing of images and videos for both understanding and generation tasks. Compared to prior UMMs with decoupled representations, TUNA's unified visual space avoids representation format mismatches introduced by separate encoders, outperforming decoupled alternatives in both understanding and generation. Moreover, we observe that stronger pretrained representation encoders consistently yield better performance across all multimodal tasks, highlighting the importance of the representation encoder. Finally, in this unified setting, jointly training on both understanding and generation data allows the two tasks to benefit from each other rather than interfere. Our extensive experiments on multimodal understanding and generation benchmarks show that TUNA achieves state-of-the-art results in image and video understanding, image and video generation, and image editing, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of its unified representation design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://tuna-ai.org/</p></details> |

We introduce CP-Bench, a minimal and fully controlled benchmark designed to isolate this capability using an extremely simple task: counting identical cubes in a synthetic scene while the camera moves and only reveals subsets of objects at any moment. Despite the simplicity of the setting, we find that state-of-the-art open-source and commercial models, including Qwen-3-VL, InternVL3, GPT-5, and Gemini-3-Pro, fail dramatically. A static-camera control variant confirms that the failure arises not from object recognition but from an inability to accumulate evidence across time. Further experiments show that neither higher sampling FPS, perception- or spatial-enhanced models, nor finetuning with additional videos leads to meaningful cross-temporal generalization. Our results reveal a fundamental limitation in modern multimodal architectures and training paradigms. CP-Bench provides a simple yet powerful diagnostic tool and establishes a clean testbed for developing models capable of genuine time-consistent visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Token pruning is a technique used to mitigate this issue by removing redundancy, but existing methods often ignore relevance to the user query or suffer from the limitations of attention mechanisms, reducing their adaptability and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Script, a plug-and-play pruning method that requires no retraining and generalizes across diverse MLLMs. Script comprises two modules: a graph-structured pruning module that removes visually redundant tokens, and a query-conditioned semantic pruning module that preserves query-relevant visual information. Together, they enhance performance on multimodal tasks. Experiments on fourteen benchmarks across image and video understanding tasks show that Script consistently achieves higher model efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to existing pruning methods. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, it achieves up to 6.8x prefill speedup and 10x FLOP reduction, while retaining 96.88% of the original performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research, Project in https://01yzzyu.github.io/script.github.io/</p></details> |

Unlike jailbreaks or targeted misclassification, the goal is to induce systematic disruption that makes the model generate incoherent or confidently incorrect outputs. Practical applications include embedding such adversarial images into websites to prevent MLLM-powered AI Agents from operating reliably. The proposed attack maximizes next-token entropy using a small ensemble of open-source MLLMs. In the white-box setting, we show that a single adversarial image can disrupt all models in the ensemble, both in the full-image and Adversarial CAPTCHA settings. Despite relying on a basic adversarial technique (PGD), the attack generates perturbations that transfer to both unseen open-source (e.g., Qwen3-VL) and proprietary (e.g., GPT-5.1) models.</p></details> |  |

However, its effectiveness is often limited by two critical challenges: the reliance on extensive human input and the inherent difficulties in resolving query ambiguity and credit assignment during reward learning. In this paper, we introduce PRIMT, a PbRL framework designed to overcome these challenges by leveraging foundation models (FMs) for multimodal synthetic feedback and trajectory synthesis. Unlike prior approaches that rely on single-modality FM evaluations, PRIMT employs a hierarchical neuro-symbolic fusion strategy, integrating the complementary strengths of large language models and vision-language models in evaluating robot behaviors for more reliable and comprehensive feedback. PRIMT also incorporates foresight trajectory generation, which reduces early-stage query ambiguity by warm-starting the trajectory buffer with bootstrapped samples, and hindsight trajectory augmentation, which enables counterfactual reasoning with a causal auxiliary loss to improve credit assignment. We evaluate PRIMT on 2 locomotion and 6 manipulation tasks on various benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over FM-based and scripted baselines.</p></details> |  |

We present a head-mounted AR "puppeteer" framework in which users control a physical robot via interacting with its virtual counterpart robot using large language model (LLM)-driven voice commands and hand-gesture interaction on the Meta Quest 3. In a within-subject user study with 42 participants performing an AR-based robotic pick-and-place pattern-matching task, we compare two interaction conditions: gesture-only (GO) and combined voice+gesture (VG). Our results show that GO currently provides more reliable and efficient control for this time-critical task, while VG introduces additional flexibility but also latency and recognition issues that can increase workload. We further explore how prior robotics experience shapes participants' perceptions of each modality. Based on these findings, we distill a set of evidence-based design guidelines for AR puppeteer metaphoric robot teleoperation, implicating multimodality as an adaptive strategy that must balance efficiency, robustness, and user expertise rather than assuming that additional modalities are universally beneficial. Our work contributes empirical insights into how multimodal (voice+gesture) interaction influences task efficiency, usability, and user experience in AR-based HRI.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is under peer review</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts for ISAC in Low-Altitude Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01750v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), providing simultaneous environmental perception and data transmission in complex aerial scenarios. By combining heterogeneous sensing modalities such as visual, radar, lidar, and positional information, multimodal ISAC can improve both situational awareness and robustness of LAWNs. However, most existing multimodal fusion approaches use static fusion strategies that treat all modalities equally and cannot adapt to channel heterogeneity or time-varying modality reliability in dynamic low-altitude environments. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for multimodal ISAC in LAWNs. Each modality is processed by a dedicated expert network, and a lightweight gating module adaptively assigns fusion weights according to the instantaneous informativeness and reliability of each modality. To improve scalability under the stringent energy constraints of aerial platforms, we further develop a sparse MoE variant that selectively activates only a subset of experts, thereby reducing computation overhead while preserving the benefits of adaptive fusion. Comprehensive simulations on three typical ISAC tasks in LAWNs demonstrate that the proposed frameworks consistently outperform conventional multimodal fusion baselines in terms of learning performance and training sample efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Seventy-four AIS patients with paired apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) scans and clinical data were analyzed. Three-dimensional ResNet-50 embeddings were fused with structured clinical variables, reduced via principal component analysis (<=12 components), and classified using linear support vector machines with eight-fold stratified group cross-validation. J1 multimodal models achieved the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.923 +/- 0.085), outperforming J0-based configurations (AUC <= 0.86). Incorporating lesion-volume features further improved model stability and interpretability. These findings demonstrate that early post-treatment diffusion MRI provides superior prognostic value to pre-treatment imaging and that combining MRI, clinical, and lesion-volume features produces a robust and interpretable framework for predicting three-month functional outcomes in AIS patients.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, conventional channel estimation methods, such as pilot signals or beam sweeping, often fail to adapt to rapidly changing communication environments. To address this limitation, multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction has gained significant attention, using various sensing data from devices such as LiDAR, radar, GPS, and RGB images to predict user locations or network conditions. Despite its promising potential, the adoption of multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction is hindered by high computational complexity, high costs, and limited datasets. Thus, in this paper, a novel resource-efficient learning framework is introduced for beam prediction, which leverages a custom-designed cross-modal relational knowledge distillation (CRKD) algorithm specifically tailored for beam prediction tasks, to transfer knowledge from a multimodal network to a radar-only student model, achieving high accuracy with reduced computational cost. To enable multimodal learning with realistic data, a novel multimodal simulation framework is developed while integrating sensor data generated from the autonomous driving simulator CARLA with MATLAB-based mmWave channel modeling, and reflecting real-world conditions. The proposed CRKD achieves its objective by distilling relational information across different feature spaces, which enhances beam prediction performance without relying on expensive sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that CRKD efficiently distills multimodal knowledge, allowing a radar-only model to achieve $94.62%$ of the teacher performance. In particular, this is achieved with just $10%$ of the teacher network's parameters, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and dependence on multimodal sensor data.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing on Dec. 01, 2025</p></details> |

Traditional keyword-based search methodologies falter in accurately identifying duplicates due to their reliance on exact textual matches, neglecting semantic similarities inherent in product titles. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable, multimodal product deduplication designed specifically for the e-commerce domain. Our approach employs a domain-specific text model grounded in BERT architecture in conjunction with MaskedAutoEncoders for image representations. Both of these architectures are augmented with dimensionality reduction techniques to produce compact 128-dimensional embeddings without significant information loss. Complementing this, we also developed a novel decider model that leverages both text and image vectors. By integrating these feature extraction mechanisms with Milvus, an optimized vector database, our system can facilitate efficient and high-precision similarity searches across extensive product catalogs exceeding 200 million items with just 100GB of system RAM consumption. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our matching system achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.90, outperforming third-party solutions which attain an F1 score of 0.83. Our findings show the potential of combining domain-specific adaptations with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to mitigate duplicate listings in large-scale e-commerce environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted to 2025 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Industrial and Goverment Track</p></details> |

Despite recent advances in multimodal techniques that leverage complementary RGB images to compensate for missing geometry, most methods still follow a Completion-by-Inpainting paradigm, synthesizing missing structures from fused latent features. We empirically show that this paradigm often results in structural inconsistencies and topological artifacts due to limited geometric and semantic constraints. To address this, we rethink the task and propose a more robust paradigm, termed Completion-by-Correction, which begins with a topologically complete shape prior generated by a pretrained image-to-3D model and performs feature-space correction to align it with the partial observation. This paradigm shifts completion from unconstrained synthesis to guided refinement, enabling structurally consistent and observation-aligned reconstruction. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce PGNet, a multi-stage framework that conducts dual-feature encoding to ground the generative prior, synthesizes a coarse yet structurally aligned scaffold, and progressively refines geometric details via hierarchical correction. Experiments on the ShapeNetViPC dataset demonstrate the superiority of PGNet over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of average Chamfer Distance (-23.5%) and F-score (+7.1%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[QuantumCanvas: A Multimodal Benchmark for Visual Learning of Atomic Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01519v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities.

| **[PSA-MF: Personality-Sentiment Aligned Multi-Level Fusion for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01442v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) is a research field that recognizes human sentiments by combining textual, visual, and audio modalities. The main challenge lies in integrating sentiment-related information from different modalities, which typically arises during the unimodal feature extraction phase and the multimodal feature fusion phase. Existing methods extract only shallow information from unimodal features during the extraction phase, neglecting sentimental differences across different personalities. During the fusion phase, they directly merge the feature information from each modality without considering differences at the feature level. This ultimately affects the model's recognition performance. To address this problem, we propose a personality-sentiment aligned multi-level fusion framework. We introduce personality traits during the feature extraction phase and propose a novel personality-sentiment alignment method to obtain personalized sentiment embeddings from the textual modality for the first time. In the fusion phase, we introduce a novel multi-level fusion method. This method gradually integrates sentimental information from textual, visual, and audio modalities through multimodal pre-fusion and a multi-level enhanced fusion strategy. Our method has been evaluated through multiple experiments on two commonly used datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 accepted |

Capturing both the unique and complementary information across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method, MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network (IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities. To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning, addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method. Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves promising performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is withdrawn to allow for substantial expansion and restructuring.

To address this, we propose a Dynamic Fusion Learning Model (DyFuLM), a multimodal framework designed to capture both hierarchical semantic representations and fine-grained emotional nuances. DyFuLM introduces two key moodules: a Hierarchical Dynamic Fusion module that adaptively integrates multi-level features, and a Gated Feature Aggregation module that regulates cross-layer information ffow to achieve balanced representation learning. Comprehensive experiments on multi-task sentiment datasets demonstrate that DyFuLM achieves 82.64% coarse-grained and 68.48% fine-grained accuracy, yielding the lowest regression errors (MAE = 0.0674, MSE = 0.0082) and the highest R^2 coefficient of determination (R^2= 0.6903). Furthermore, the ablation study validates the effectiveness of each module in DyFuLM. When all modules are removed, the accuracy drops by 0.91% for coarse-grained and 0.68% for fine-grained tasks. Keeping only the gated fusion module causes decreases of 0.75% and 0.55%, while removing the dynamic loss mechanism results in drops of 0.78% and 0.26% for coarse-grained and fine-grained sentiment classification, respectively. These results demonstrate that each module contributes significantly to feature interaction and task balance. Overall, the experimental findings further validate that DyFuLM enhances sentiment representation and overall performance through effective hierarchical feature fusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, preprint.

| **[Structured Spectral Reasoning for Frequency-Adaptive Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01372v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation aims to integrate collaborative signals with heterogeneous content such as visual and textual information, but remains challenged by modality-specific noise, semantic inconsistency, and unstable propagation over user-item graphs. These issues are often exacerbated by naive fusion or shallow modeling strategies, leading to degraded generalization and poor robustness. While recent work has explored the frequency domain as a lens to separate stable from noisy signals, most methods rely on static filtering or reweighting, lacking the ability to reason over spectral structure or adapt to modality-specific reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) framework for frequency-aware multimodal recommendation. Our method follows a four-stage pipeline: (i) Decompose graph-based multimodal signals into spectral bands via graph-guided transformations to isolate semantic granularity; (ii) Modulate band-level reliability with spectral band masking, a training-time masking with a prediction-consistency objective that suppresses brittle frequency components; (iii) Fuse complementary frequency cues using hyperspectral reasoning with low-rank cross-band interaction; and (iv) Align modality-specific spectral features via contrastive regularization to promote semantic and structural consistency. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, particularly under sparse and cold-start settings. Additional analyses indicate that structured spectral modeling improves robustness and provides clearer diagnostics of how different bands contribute to performance.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we introduce SUPERChem, a benchmark of 500 expert-curated reasoning-intensive chemistry problems, covering diverse subfields and provided in both multimodal and text-only formats. Original content and an iterative curation pipeline eliminate flawed items and mitigate data contamination. Each problem is paired with an expert-authored solution path, enabling Reasoning Path Fidelity (RPF) scoring to evaluate reasoning quality beyond final-answer accuracy. Evaluations against a human baseline of 40.3% accuracy show that even the best-performing model, GPT-5 (High), reaches only 38.5%, followed closely by Gemini 2.5 Pro (37.9%) and DeepSeek-V3.1-Think (37.3%). SUPERChem elicits multi-step, multimodal reasoning, reveals model-dependent effects of visual information, and distinguishes high-fidelity reasoners from heuristic ones. By providing a challenging benchmark and a reliable evaluation framework, SUPERChem aims to facilitate the advancement of LLMs toward expert-level chemical intelligence.

However, current approaches often struggle to model intra- and inter-modal interactions efficiently and effectively due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the inputs. A major challenge is capturing critical prognostic events that, though few, underlie the complexity of the observed inputs and largely determine patient outcomes. These events, manifested as high-level structural signals such as spatial histologic patterns or pathway co-activations, are typically sparse, patient-specific, and unannotated, making them inherently difficult to uncover. To address this, we propose SlotSPE, a slot-based framework for structural prognostic event modeling. Specifically, inspired by the principle of factorial coding, we compress each patient's multimodal inputs into compact, modality-specific sets of mutually distinctive slots using slot attention. By leveraging these slot representations as encodings for prognostic events, our framework enables both efficient and effective modeling of complex intra- and inter-modal interactions, while also facilitating seamless incorporation of biological priors that enhance prognostic relevance. Extensive experiments on ten cancer benchmarks show that SlotSPE outperforms existing methods in 8 out of 10 cohorts, achieving an overall improvement of 2.9%. It remains robust under missing genomic data and delivers markedly improved interpretability through structured event decomposition.</p></details> | 37 pages, 14 Figures |

To tackle this, we present MM-ACT, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that integrates text, image, and action in shared token space and performs generation across all three modalities. MM-ACT adopts a re-mask parallel decoding strategy for text and image generation, and employs a one-step parallel decoding strategy for action generation to improve efficiency. We introduce Context-Shared Multimodal Learning, a unified training paradigm that supervises generation in all three modalities from a shared context, enhancing action generation through cross-modal learning. Experiments were conducted on the LIBERO simulation and Franka real-robot setups as well as RoboTwin2.0 to assess in-domain and out-of-domain performances respectively. Our approach achieves a success rate of 96.3% on LIBERO, 72.0% across three tasks of real Franka, and 52.38% across eight bimanual tasks of RoboTwin2.0 with an additional gain of 9.25% from cross-modal learning. We release our codes, models and data at https://github.com/HHYHRHY/MM-ACT.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Augmenting Intra-Modal Understanding in MLLMs for Robust Multimodal Keyphrase Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00928v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal keyphrase generation (MKP) aims to extract a concise set of keyphrases that capture the essential meaning of paired image-text inputs, enabling structured understanding, indexing, and retrieval of multimedia data across the web and social platforms. Success in this task demands effectively bridging the semantic gap between heterogeneous modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve superior cross-modal understanding by leveraging massive pretraining on image-text corpora, we observe that they often struggle with modality bias and fine-grained intra-modal feature extraction. This oversight leads to a lack of robustness in real-world scenarios where multimedia data is noisy, along with incomplete or misaligned modalities. To address this problem, we propose AimKP, a novel framework that explicitly reinforces intra-modal semantic learning in MLLMs while preserving cross-modal alignment. AimKP incorporates two core innovations: (i) Progressive Modality Masking, which forces fine-grained feature extraction from corrupted inputs by progressively masking modality information during training; (ii) Gradient-based Filtering, that identifies and discards noisy samples, preventing them from corrupting the model's core cross-modal learning. Extensive experiments validate AimKP's effectiveness in multimodal keyphrase generation and its robustness across different scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Multimodal Prototype Learning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03657v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing attention to pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), \eg, CLIP, substantial efforts have been devoted to many downstream tasks, especially in test-time adaptation (TTA). However, previous works focus on learning prototypes only in the textual modality while overlooking the ambiguous semantics in class names. These ambiguities lead to textual prototypes that are insufficient to capture visual concepts, resulting in limited performance. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ProtoMM}, a training-free framework that constructs multimodal prototypes to adapt VLMs during the test time. By viewing the prototype as a discrete distribution over the textual descriptions and visual particles, ProtoMM has the ability to combine the multimodal features for comprehensive prototype learning. More importantly, the visual particles are dynamically updated as the testing stream flows. This allows our multimodal prototypes to continually learn from the data, enhancing their generalizability in unseen scenarios. In addition, we quantify the importance of the prototypes and test images by formulating their semantic distance as an optimal transport problem. Extensive experiments on 15 zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a 1.03\% average accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its variant datasets.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[CrossVid: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Cross-Video Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12263v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-Video Reasoning (CVR) presents a significant challenge in video understanding, which requires simultaneous understanding of multiple videos to aggregate and compare information across groups of videos. Most existing video understanding benchmarks focus on single-video analysis, failing to assess the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to simultaneously reason over various videos. Recent benchmarks evaluate MLLMs' capabilities on multi-view videos that capture different perspectives of the same scene. However, their limited tasks hinder a thorough assessment of MLLMs in diverse real-world CVR scenarios. To this end, we introduce CrossVid, the first benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning ability in cross-video contexts. Firstly, CrossVid encompasses a wide spectrum of hierarchical tasks, comprising four high-level dimensions and ten specific tasks, thereby closely reflecting the complex and varied nature of real-world video understanding. Secondly, CrossVid provides 5,331 videos, along with 9,015 challenging question-answering pairs, spanning single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended question formats. Through extensive experiments on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5-Pro performs best on CrossVid, achieving an average accuracy of 50.4%. Notably, our in-depth case study demonstrates that most current MLLMs struggle with CVR tasks, primarily due to their inability to integrate or compare evidence distributed across multiple videos for reasoning. These insights highlight the potential of CrossVid to guide future advancements in enhancing MLLMs' CVR capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (main track).

However, existing MKE benchmarks primarily assess final answer correctness while neglecting the quality of intermediate reasoning and robustness to visually rephrased inputs. To address this limitation, we introduce MMQAKE, the first benchmark for multimodal multihop question answering with knowledge editing. MMQAKE evaluates (1) a model's ability to reason over 2-5-hop factual chains that span both text and images, including performance at each intermediate step, and (2) robustness to visually rephrased inputs in multihop questions. Our evaluation shows that current MKE methods often struggle to consistently update and reason over multimodal reasoning chains after knowledge edits. To overcome these challenges, we propose Hybrid-DMKG, a hybrid reasoning framework built on a dynamic multimodal knowledge graph (DMKG) to enable accurate multihop reasoning over updated multimodal knowledge. Hybrid-DMKG first uses a large language model to decompose multimodal multihop questions into sequential sub-questions, then applies a multimodal retrieval model to locate updated facts by jointly encoding each sub-question with candidate entities and their associated images. For answer inference, a hybrid reasoning module operates over the DMKG via two parallel paths: (1) relation linking prediction, and (2) RAG reasoning with large vision-language models. A decision module aggregates evidence from both paths to select the most credible answer. Experimental results on MMQAKE show that Hybrid-DMKG significantly outperforms existing MKE approaches, achieving higher accuracy and improved robustness to knowledge updates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We present Med-CMR, a fine-grained Medical Complex Multimodal Reasoning benchmark. Med-CMR distinguishes from existing counterparts by three core features: 1) Systematic capability decomposition, splitting medical multimodal reasoning into fine-grained visual understanding and multi-step reasoning to enable targeted evaluation; 2) Challenging task design, with visual understanding across three key dimensions (small-object detection, fine-detail discrimination, spatial understanding) and reasoning covering four clinically relevant scenarios (temporal prediction, causal reasoning, long-tail generalization, multi-source integration); 3) Broad, high-quality data coverage, comprising 20,653 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs spanning 11 organ systems and 12 imaging modalities, validated via a rigorous two-stage (human expert + model-assisted) review to ensure clinical authenticity. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs with Med-CMR, revealing GPT-5 as the top-performing commercial model: 57.81 accuracy on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and a 48.70 open-ended score, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro (49.87 MCQ accuracy, 45.98 open-ended score) and leading open-source model Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (49.34 MCQ accuracy, 42.62 open-ended score). However, specialized medical MLLMs do not reliably outperform strong general models, and long-tail generalization emerges as the dominant failure mode. Med-CMR thus provides a stress test for visual-reasoning integration and rare-case robustness in medical MLLMs, and a rigorous yardstick for future clinical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient LLM-Jailbreaking via Multimodal-LLM Jailbreak](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20015v3)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on jailbreaking attacks against large language models (LLMs), eliciting them to generate objectionable content in response to harmful user queries. Unlike previous LLM-jailbreak methods that directly orient to LLMs, our approach begins by constructing a multimodal large language model (MLLM) built upon the target LLM. Subsequently, we perform an efficient MLLM jailbreak and obtain a jailbreaking embedding. Finally, we convert the embedding into a textual jailbreaking suffix to carry out the jailbreak of target LLM. Compared to the direct LLM-jailbreak methods, our indirect jailbreaking approach is more efficient, as MLLMs are more vulnerable to jailbreak than pure LLM. Additionally, to improve the attack success rate of jailbreak, we propose an image-text semantic matching scheme to identify a suitable initial input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art jailbreak methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior cross-class generalization abilities.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, have enabled transformative progress in medical imaging analysis. Deep learning-based computer vision models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, and hybrid attention architectures, can automatically extract complex spatial, morphological, and temporal patterns from multimodal imaging data including MRI, CT, PET, mammography, histopathology, and ultrasound. These models surpass traditional radiological assessment by identifying subtle tissue abnormalities and tumor microenvironment variations invisible to the human eye. At a broader scale, the integration of multimodal imaging with radiogenomics linking quantitative imaging features with genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenetic biomarkers has introduced a new paradigm for personalized oncology. This radiogenomic fusion allows the prediction of tumor genotype, immune response, molecular subtypes, and treatment resistance without invasive biopsies.</p></details> |  |

However, text-driven 4D scene editing remains under-explored due to the challenge of ensuring both multi-view and temporal consistency across space and time during editing. Existing studies rely on 2D diffusion models that edit frames independently, often causing motion distortion, geometric drift, and incomplete editing. We introduce Dynamic-eDiTor, a training-free text-driven 4D editing framework leveraging Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) and 4DGS. This mechanism consists of Spatio-Temporal Sub-Grid Attention (STGA) for locally consistent cross-view and temporal fusion, and Context Token Propagation (CTP) for global propagation via token inheritance and optical-flow-guided token replacement. Together, these components allow Dynamic-eDiTor to perform seamless, globally consistent multi-view video without additional training and directly optimize pre-trained source 4DGS. Extensive experiments on multi-view video dataset DyNeRF demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing fidelity and both multi-view and temporal consistency prior approaches.

However, practical biodiversity modelling remains fragmented; separate pipelines and models are built for each dataset and objective, which limits reuse across regions and taxa. In response, we present BioAnalyst, to our knowledge the first multimodal Foundation Model tailored to biodiversity analysis and conservation planning in Europe at $0.25^{\circ}$ spatial resolution targeting regional to national-scale applications. BioAnalyst employs a transformer-based architecture, pre-trained on extensive multimodal datasets that align species occurrence records with remote sensing indicators, climate and environmental variables. Post pre-training, the model is adapted via lightweight roll-out fine-tuning to a range of downstream tasks, including joint species distribution modelling, biodiversity dynamics and population trend forecasting. The model is evaluated on two representative downstream use cases: (i) joint species distribution modelling and with 500 vascular plant species (ii) monthly climate linear probing with temperature and precipitation data. Our findings show that BioAnalyst can provide a strong baseline both for biotic and abiotic tasks, acting as a macroecological simulator with a yearly forecasting horizon and monthly resolution, offering the first application of this type of modelling in the biodiversity domain. We have open-sourced the model weights, training and fine-tuning pipelines to advance AI-driven ecological research.</p></details> |  |

To realize this potential, a key research question remains open: how can a humanoid execute the human actions from generated videos in a zero-shot manner? This challenge arises because generated videos are often noisy and exhibit morphological distortions that make direct imitation difficult compared to real video. To address this, we introduce a two-stage pipeline. First, we lift video pixels into a 4D human representation and then retarget to the humanoid morphology. Second, we propose GenMimic-a physics-aware reinforcement learning policy conditioned on 3D keypoints, and trained with symmetry regularization and keypoint-weighted tracking rewards. As a result, GenMimic can mimic human actions from noisy, generated videos. We curate GenMimicBench, a synthetic human-motion dataset generated using two video generation models across a spectrum of actions and contexts, establishing a benchmark for assessing zero-shot generalization and policy robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate improvements over strong baselines in simulation and confirm coherent, physically stable motion tracking on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot without fine-tuning. This work offers a promising path to realizing the potential of video generation models as high-level policies for robot control.</p></details> | <details><summary>For p...</summary><p>For project website, see https://genmimic.github.io</p></details> |

We find that the RNN stores future moves (plans) as activations in particular channels of the hidden state, which we call path channels. A high activation in a particular location means that, when a box is in that location, it will get pushed in the channel's assigned direction. We examine the convolutional kernels between path channels and find that they encode the change in position resulting from each possible action, thus representing part of a learned transition model. The RNN constructs plans by starting at the boxes and goals. These kernels extend activations in path channels forwards from boxes and backwards from the goal. Negative values are placed in channels at obstacles. This causes the extension kernels to propagate the negative value in reverse, thus pruning the last few steps and letting an alternative plan emerge; a form of backtracking. Our work shows that, a precise understanding of the plan representation allows us to directly understand the bidirectional planning-like algorithm learned by model-free training in more familiar terms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Mechanistic Interpretability Workshop at NeurIPS 2025. 34 pages, 26 figures</p></details> |

However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative statistical divergences. Key findings: (1) on unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance; (2) supervised contrastive learning with Euclidean distance as the feature space metric is improved by replacing the standard loss function with Jenson-Shannon divergence (JSD); (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL with a bounded $f$-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of considering divergence choices in representation learning optimization.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional LSTMs suffer from high parameter redundancy and limited nonlinear expressivity. In this work, we propose the Quantum-inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Long Short-Term Memory (QKAN-LSTM), which integrates Data Re-Uploading Activation (DARUAN) modules into the gating structure of LSTMs. Each DARUAN acts as a quantum variational activation function (QVAF), enhancing frequency adaptability and enabling an exponentially enriched spectral representation without multi-qubit entanglement. The resulting architecture preserves quantum-level expressivity while remaining fully executable on classical hardware. Empirical evaluations on three datasets, Damped Simple Harmonic Motion, Bessel Function, and Urban Telecommunication, demonstrate that QKAN-LSTM achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalization with a 79% reduction in trainable parameters compared to classical LSTMs. We extend the framework to the Jiang-Huang-Chen-Goan Network (JHCG Net), which generalizes KAN to encoder-decoder structures, and then further use QKAN to realize the latent KAN, thereby creating a Hybrid QKAN (HQKAN) for hierarchical representation learning. The proposed HQKAN-LSTM thus provides a scalable and interpretable pathway toward quantum-inspired sequential modeling in real-world data environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAMEN: Resolution-Adjustable Multimodal Encoder for Earth Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05025v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Earth observation (EO) data spans a wide range of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, from high-resolution optical imagery to low resolution multispectral products or radar time series. While recent foundation models have improved multimodal integration for learning meaningful representations, they often expect fixed input resolutions or are based on sensor-specific encoders limiting generalization across heterogeneous EO modalities. To overcome these limitations we introduce RAMEN, a resolution-adjustable multimodal encoder that learns a shared visual representation across EO data in a fully sensor-agnostic manner. RAMEN treats the modality and spatial and temporal resolutions as key input data features, enabling coherent analysis across modalities within a unified latent space. Its main methodological contribution is to define spatial resolution as a controllable output parameter, giving users direct control over the desired level of detail at inference and allowing explicit trade-offs between spatial precision and computational cost. We train a single, unified transformer encoder reconstructing masked multimodal EO data drawn from diverse sources, ensuring generalization across sensors and resolutions. Once pretrained, RAMEN transfers effectively to both known and unseen sensor configurations and outperforms larger state-of-the-art models on the community-standard PANGAEA benchmark, containing various multi-sensor and multi-resolution downstream tasks. Our code and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/nicolashoudre/RAMEN.</p></details> |  |

In modern applications such as single-cell multi-omics, both shared and modality-specific features are critical for characterizing cell states and supporting downstream analyses. Ideally, modality-specific features should be independent of shared ones while also capturing all complementary information within each modality. This tradeoff is naturally expressed through information-theoretic criteria, but mutual-information-based objectives are difficult to estimate reliably, and their variational surrogates often underperform in practice. In this paper, we introduce IndiSeek, a novel disentangled representation learning approach that addresses this challenge by combining an independence-enforcing objective with a computationally efficient reconstruction loss that bounds conditional mutual information. This formulation explicitly balances independence and completeness, enabling principled extraction of modality-specific features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndiSeek on synthetic simulations, a CITE-seq dataset and multiple real-world multi-modal benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The first contribution introduces the Causal Dynamic Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE), a model for estimating Individual Treatment Effects (ITEs) by capturing unobserved heterogeneity in treatment response driven by latent risk factors that affect only outcomes. CDVAE comes with theoretical guarantees on valid latent adjustment and generalization bounds for ITE error. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that CDVAE outperforms baselines, and that state-of-the-art models greatly improve when augmented with its latent substitutes, approaching oracle performance without access to true adjustment variables. The second contribution proposes an efficient framework for long-term counterfactual regression based on RNNs enhanced with Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and InfoMax. It captures long-range dependencies under time-varying confounding while avoiding the computational cost of transformers, achieving state-of-the-art results and introducing CPC into causal inference. The third contribution advances CRL by addressing how latent causes manifest in observed variables. We introduce a model-agnostic interpretability layer based on the geometry of the decoder Jacobian. A sparse self-expression prior induces modular, possibly overlapping groups of observed features aligned with shared latent influences. We provide recovery guarantees in both disjoint and overlapping settings and show that meaningful latent-to-observed structure can be recovered without anchor features or single-parent assumptions. Scalable Jacobian-based regularization techniques are also developed.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis manuscript</p></details> |

While existing neural operators (NOs) have shown promise for solving partial differential equations, they remain limited in practice due to poor scalability on dense grids, error accumulation during dynamic unrolling, and task-specific design. ECHO addresses these challenges through three key innovations. (i) It employs a hierarchical convolutional encode-decode architecture that achieves a 100 $\times$ spatio-temporal compression while preserving fidelity on mesh points. (ii) It incorporates a training and adaptation strategy that enables high-resolution PDE solution generation from sparse input grids. (iii) It adopts a generative modeling paradigm that learns complete trajectory segments, mitigating long-horizon error drift. The training strategy decouples representation learning from downstream task supervision, allowing the model to tackle multiple tasks such as trajectory generation, forward and inverse problems, and interpolation. The generative model further supports both conditional and unconditional generation. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on million-point simulations across diverse PDE systems featuring complex geometries, high-frequency dynamics, and long-term horizons.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in SLT with Large Language Models has side stepped this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information such as names, places, and technical terms. We introduce SignBind-LLM, a modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign, ChicagoFSWildPlus, and BOBSL datasets with a BLEU-4 score of 22.1, 73.2% letter accuracy and BLEU-4 score of 6.8 respectively. These results validate our core hypothesis: isolating and solving distinct recognition tasks before fusion provides a more powerful and effective pathway to robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crack detection by holomorphic neural networks and transfer-learning-enhanced genetic optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04947v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new strategy for detecting cracks in 2D solids based on strain data is introduced. Crack detection is formulated as an inverse problem and solved using genetic optimization. The novelty lies in the evaluation of the model response at each generation. Specifically, the solution to the corresponding plane elasticity problem is expressed via holomorphic potentials, which are determined by training two holomorphic neural networks. As the potentials satisfy equilibrium and traction-free conditions along the crack faces a priori, the training proceeds quickly based solely on boundary information. Training efficiency is further improved by splitting the genetic search into long-range and short-range stages, enabling the use of transfer learning in the latter. The new strategy is tested on three benchmark problems, showing that an optimal number of training epochs exists that provides the best overall performance. A comparison is also made with a popular crack detection approach that uses XFEM to compute the model response. Under the assumption of identical stress-field representation accuracy, the proposed method is found to be between 7 and 23 times faster than the XFEM-based approach. While the strategy is presented here for the simplified case of a single internal crack, generalization is feasible. Overall, the present findings demonstrate that combining genetic optimization with holomorphic neural networks and transfer learning offers a promising avenue for developing crack detection strategies with higher efficiency than those currently available.</p></details> |  |

Employing gating mechanisms for multimodal fusion, we aim to surpass limitations inherent in traditional unimodal recognition methods while exploring novel possibilities for diverse applications. Through an exhaustive investigation of gating mechanisms and adaptive weighting-based fusion architectures, our methodology enables the selective integration of relevant information from various modalities, thereby bolstering both accuracy and robustness in action recognition tasks. We meticulously examine various gated fusion strategies to pinpoint the most effective approach for multimodal action recognition, showcasing its superiority over conventional unimodal methods. Gating mechanisms facilitate the extraction of pivotal features, resulting in a more holistic representation of actions and substantial enhancements in recognition performance. Our evaluations across human action recognition, violence action detection, and multiple self-supervised learning tasks on benchmark datasets demonstrate promising advancements in accuracy. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize action recognition systems across diverse fields. The fusion of multimodal information promises sophisticated applications in surveillance and human-computer interaction, especially in contexts related to active assisted living.</p></details> |  |

This characteristic creates an intrinsic synergy between representation learning and data generation. However, the generative quality of standard NFs is limited by poor semantic representations from log-likelihood optimization. To remedy this, we propose a novel alignment strategy that creatively leverages the invertibility of NFs: instead of regularizing the forward pass, we align the intermediate features of the generative (reverse) pass with representations from a powerful vision foundation model, demonstrating superior effectiveness over naive alignment. We also introduce a novel training-free, test-time optimization algorithm for classification, which provides a more intrinsic evaluation of the NF's embedded semantic knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the training of NFs by over 3.3$\times$, while simultaneously delivering significant improvements in both generative quality and classification accuracy. New state-of-the-art results for NFs are established on ImageNet 64$\times$64 and 256$\times$256.

| **[SoftStep: Learning Sparse Similarity Powers Deep Neighbor-Based Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08139v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neighbor-based methods are a natural alternative to linear prediction for tabular data when relationships between inputs and targets exhibit complexity such as nonlinearity, periodicity, or heteroscedasticity. Yet in deep learning on unstructured data, nonparametric neighbor-based approaches are rarely implemented in lieu of simple linear heads. This is primarily due to the ability of systems equipped with linear regression heads to co-learn internal representations along with the linear head's parameters. To unlock the full potential of neighbor-based methods in neural networks we introduce SoftStep, a parametric module that learns sparse instance-wise similarity measures directly from data. When integrated with existing neighbor-based methods, SoftStep enables regression models that consistently outperform linear heads across diverse architectures, domains, and training scenarios. We focus on regression tasks, where we show theoretically that neighbor-based prediction with a mean squared error objective constitutes a metric learning algorithm that induces well-structured embedding spaces. We then demonstrate analytically and empirically that this representational structure translates into superior performance when combined with the sparse, instance-wise similarity measures introduced by SoftStep. Beyond regression, SoftStep is a general method for learning instance-wise similarity in deep neural networks, with broad applicability to attention mechanisms, metric learning, representational alignment, and related paradigms.</p></details> |  |

Automated yoga pose classification has therefore gained importance to reduce reliance on expert practitioners. While human pose keypoint extraction models have shown high potential in action recognition, systematic benchmarking for yoga pose recognition remains limited, as prior works often focus solely on raw images or a single pose extraction model. In this study, we introduce a curated dataset, 'Yoga-16', which addresses limitations of existing datasets, and systematically evaluate three deep learning architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception), using three input modalities (direct images, MediaPipe Pose skeleton images, and YOLOv8 Pose skeleton images). Our experiments demonstrate that skeleton-based representations outperform raw image inputs, with the highest accuracy of 96.09% achieved by VGG16 with MediaPipe Pose skeleton input. Additionally, we provide interpretability analysis using Grad-CAM, offering insights into model decision-making for yoga pose classification with cross-validation analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[On-Policy Optimization with Group Equivalent Preference for Multi-Programming Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12723v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in code generation tasks. However, a significant performance disparity persists between popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies. Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones, while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across multiple programming languages.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce AcuLa (Audio-Clinical Understanding via Language Alignment), a lightweight post-training framework that instills semantic understanding into any audio encoder by aligning it with a medical language model, which acts as a "semantic teacher." To enable alignment at scale, we construct a large-scale dataset by leveraging off-the-shelf large language models to translate the rich, structured metadata accompanying existing audio recordings into coherent clinical reports. Our alignment strategy combines a representation-level contrastive objective with a self-supervised modeling, ensuring that the model learns clinical semantics while preserving fine-grained temporal cues. AcuLa achieves state-of-the-art results across 18 diverse cardio-respiratory tasks from 10 different datasets, improving the mean AUROC on classification benchmarks from 0.68 to 0.79 and, on the most challenging COVID-19 cough detection task, boosting the AUROC from 0.55 to 0.89. Our work demonstrates that this audio-language alignment transforms purely acoustic models into clinically-aware diagnostic tools, establishing a novel paradigm for enhancing physiological understanding in audio-based health monitoring.</p></details> |  |

We address the question of how to tokenize buildings by unifying heterogeneous feature sets of architectural elements into sequences while preserving compositional structure. Such feature sets are represented as a sparse attribute-feature matrix that captures room properties. We then design a unified embedding module that learns joint representations of categorical and possibly correlated continuous feature groups. Lastly, we train a single Transformer backbone in two modes: an encoder-only pathway that yields high-fidelity room embeddings, and an encoder-decoder pipeline for autoregressive prediction of room entities, referred to as Data-Driven Entity Prediction (DDEP). Experiments across retrieval and generative layout synthesis show that SBM learns compact room embeddings that reliably cluster by type and topology, enabling strong semantic retrieval. In DDEP mode, SBM produces functionally sound layouts, with fewer collisions and boundary violations and improved navigability.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 page References, 4 figures</p></details> |

It has demonstrated strong generative capabilities and attracted significant attention as a simulation-free flow-based framework capable of learning exact data densities. Motivated by these advances, we propose LatentFM, a flow-based model operating in the latent space for medical image segmentation. To model the data distribution, we first design two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode both medical images and their corresponding masks into a lower-dimensional latent space. We then estimate a conditional velocity field that guides the flow based on the input image. By sampling multiple latent representations, our method synthesizes diverse segmentation outputs whose pixel-wise variance reliably captures the underlying data distribution, enabling both highly accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions. Furthermore, we generate confidence maps that quantify the model certainty, providing clinicians with richer information for deeper analysis. We conduct experiments on two datasets, ISIC-2018 and CVC-Clinic, and compare our method with several prior baselines, including both deterministic and generative approach models. Through comprehensive evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative results show that our approach achieves superior segmentation accuracy while remaining highly efficient in the latent space.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaFiTe: A Generative Latent Field for 3D Native Texturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04786v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-fidelity, seamless textures directly on 3D surfaces, what we term 3D-native texturing, remains a fundamental open challenge, with the potential to overcome long-standing limitations of UV-based and multi-view projection methods. However, existing native approaches are constrained by the absence of a powerful and versatile latent representation, which severely limits the fidelity and generality of their generated textures. We identify this representation gap as the principal barrier to further progress. We introduce LaFiTe, a framework that addresses this challenge by learning to generate textures as a 3D generative sparse latent color field. At its core, LaFiTe employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode complex surface appearance into a sparse, structured latent space, which is subsequently decoded into a continuous color field. This representation achieves unprecedented fidelity, exceeding state-of-the-art methods by >10 dB PSNR in reconstruction, by effectively disentangling texture appearance from mesh topology and UV parameterization. Building upon this strong representation, a conditional rectified-flow model synthesizes high-quality, coherent textures across diverse styles and geometries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaFiTe not only sets a new benchmark for 3D-native texturing but also enables flexible downstream applications such as material synthesis and texture super-resolution, paving the way for the next generation of 3D content creation workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vast-ai-research.github.io/LaFiTe/</p></details> |

To overcome these limitations, we propose a melody-driven SVS framework capable of synthesizing arbitrary lyrics following any reference melody, without relying on phoneme-level alignment. Our method builds on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, enhanced with a dedicated melody extraction module that derives melody representations directly from reference audio. To ensure robust melody encoding, we employ a teacher model to guide the optimization of the melody extractor, alongside an implicit alignment mechanism that enforces similarity distribution constraints for improved melodic stability and coherence. Additionally, we refine duration modeling using weakly annotated song data and introduce a Flow-GRPO reinforcement learning strategy with a multi-objective reward function to jointly enhance pronunciation clarity and melodic fidelity. Experiments show that our model achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both objective measures and subjective listening tests, especially in zero-shot and lyric adaptation settings, while maintaining high audio quality without manual annotation. This work offers a practical and scalable solution for advancing data-efficient singing voice synthesis. To support reproducibility, we release our inference code and model checkpoints.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

Where $ε$-machines capture the predictive temporal structure and intrinsic computation of ABM-generated time series, diffusion models characterize high-dimensional cross-sectional distributions, learn underlying data manifolds, and enable synthetic generation of plausible population-level outcomes. We provide a formal analysis demonstrating that the two approaches operate on distinct mathematical domains -processes vs.\ distributions- and show that their combination yields a two-axis representation of ABM behavior based on temporal organization and distributional geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to integrate computational mechanics with score-based generative modeling for the structural analysis of ABM outputs, thereby situating ABM characterization within the broader landscape of modern machine-learning methods for density estimation and intrinsic computation. The framework is validated using the same elder-caregiver ABM dataset introduced in the companion paper, and we provide precise definitions and propositions formalizing the mathematical complementarity between $ε$-machines and diffusion models. This establishes a principled methodology for jointly analyzing temporal predictability and high-dimensional distributional structure in complex simulation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

Existing methods such as domain randomization, adaptation, and sim-real calibration often require extensive tuning or fail to generalize to unseen scenarios. To address this issue, we observe that if domain-invariant features are utilized during policy training in simulation, and the same features can be extracted and provided as the input to policy during real-world deployment, the domain gap can be effectively bridged, leading to significantly improved policy generalization. Accordingly, we propose Semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (S2GS), a novel representation method that extracts object-centric, domain-invariant spatial features. S2GS constructs multi-view 2D semantic fields and projects them into a unified 3D space via feature-level Gaussian splatting. A semantic filtering mechanism removes irrelevant background content, ensuring clean and consistent inputs for policy learning. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2GS, we adopt Diffusion Policy as the downstream learning algorithm and conduct experiments in the ManiSkill simulation environment, followed by real-world deployment. Results demonstrate that S2GS significantly improves sim-to-real transferability, maintaining high and stable task performance in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRINITY: An Evolved LLM Coordinator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04695v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining diverse foundation models is promising, but weight-merging is limited by mismatched architectures and closed APIs. Trinity addresses this with a lightweight coordinator that orchestrates collaboration among large language models (LLMs). The coordinator, comprising a compact language model (approximately $0.6$B parameters) and a lightweight head (approximately $10$K parameters), is optimized with an evolutionary strategy for efficient and adaptive delegation. Trinity processes queries over multiple turns, where at each turn the coordinator assigns one of three roles (Thinker, Worker, or Verifier) to a selected LLM, effectively offloading complex skill acquisition from the coordinator itself. Experiments show that Trinity consistently outperforms individual models and existing methods across coding, math, reasoning, and domain knowledge tasks, and generalizes robustly to out-of-distribution tasks. On standard benchmarks, Trinity achieves state-of-the-art results, including a score of 86.2% on LiveCodeBench. Theoretical and empirical analyses identify two main factors behind this performance: (1) the coordinator's hidden-state representations provide rich contextualization of inputs, and (2) under high dimensionality and strict budget constraints, the separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy offers advantages over reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and random search by exploiting potential block-epsilon-separability.</p></details> |  |

We present WeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes weather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the text context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a Training-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large multi-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through human-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather, and could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the scene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the dynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight and fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized by the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and image-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather conditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate that, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall rates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods. Notably, it improves Recall@1 by +13.37\% under night conditions and by 18.69\% under fog and snow conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-shot Class-incremental Fault Diagnosis by Preserving Class-Agnostic Knowledge with Dual-Granularity Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16634v4)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Fault Diagnosis (FSC-FD), which aims to continuously learn from new fault classes with only a few samples without forgetting old ones, is critical for real-world industrial systems. However, this challenging task severely amplifies the issues of catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity Representations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN explicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a fine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order Interaction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific features from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation stream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared across all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a multi-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained knowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting and alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy. Moreover, a decoupled Balanced Random Forest classifier is employed to counter the decision boundary bias caused by data imbalance. Extensive experiments on the TEP benchmark and a real-world MFF dataset demonstrate that our proposed DGGN achieves superior diagnostic performance and stability compared to state-of-the-art FSC-FD approaches.

A number of recent studies have demonstrated convincing reconstruction of intelligible speech from surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical recordings by predicting a series of phonemes or words and using downstream language models to obtain meaningful sentences. A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech. While this has been achieved recently using intracortical data, further work is needed to obtain comparable results with surface ECoG recordings. In particular, optimizing neural decoders becomes critical in this case. Here we present an offline speech decoding pipeline based on an encoder-decoder deep neural architecture, integrating Vision Transformers and contrastive learning to enhance the direct regression of speech from ECoG signals. The approach is evaluated on two datasets, one obtained with clinical subdural electrodes in an epileptic patient, and another obtained with the fully implantable WIMAGINE epidural system in a participant of a motor BCI trial. To our knowledge this presents a first attempt to decode speech from a fully implantable and wireless epidural recording system offering perspectives for long-term use.</p></details> |  |

In crawl spaces, current proprioceptive locomotion learning methods are difficult to achieve traverse because only ground features are inferred. In this study, a point cloud supervised RL framework for proprioceptive locomotion in crawl spaces is proposed. A state estimation network is designed to estimate the robot's collision states as well as ground and spatial features for locomotion. A point cloud feature extraction method is proposed to supervise the state estimation network. The method uses representation of the point cloud in polar coordinate frame and MLPs for efficient feature extraction. Experiments demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, our method exhibits faster iteration time in the training and more agile locomotion in crawl spaces. This study enhances the ability of legged robots to traverse constrained spaces without requiring exteroceptive sensors.</p></details> | Accepted by RA-L |

In mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, misclassifying a harmful compound as benign can trigger substantial scientific, regulatory, and health risks, whereas false alarms primarily increase laboratory workload. Modern representations transform molecular graphs into persistence image tensors that preserve multiscale geometric and topological structure, yet existing tensor classifiers and deep tensor neural networks provide no finite-sample guarantees on type I error and often exhibit severe error inflation in practice. We develop the first Tensor Neyman-Pearson (Tensor-NP) classification framework that achieves finite-sample control of type I error while exploiting the multi-mode structure of tensor data. Under a tensor-normal mixture model, we derive the oracle NP discriminant, characterize its Tucker low-rank manifold geometry, and establish tensor-specific margin and conditional detection conditions enabling high-probability bounds on excess type II error. We further propose a Discriminant Tensor Iterative Projection estimator and a Tensor-NP Neural Classifier combining deep learning with Tensor-NP umbrella calibration, yielding the first distribution-free NP-valid methods for multiway data. Across four biochemical datasets, Tensor-NP classifiers maintain type I errors at prespecified levels while delivering competitive type II error performance, providing reliable tools for asymmetric-risk decisions with complex molecular tensors.</p></details> | <details><summary>59 pa...</summary><p>59 pages, 5 figures and 12 tables (including Supplementary Material)</p></details> |

However, obtaining a complete multi-phase series is often clinically unfeasible due to radiation concerns or scanning limitations, leading to the "missing modality" problem. Existing deep learning approaches typically treat missing phases as absent independent channels, ignoring the inherent temporal continuity of hemodynamics. In this work, we propose Time Attenuated Representation Disentanglement (TARDis), a novel physics-aware framework that redefines missing modalities as missing sample points on a continuous Time-Attenuation Curve. TARDis explicitly disentangles the latent feature space into a time-invariant static component (anatomy) and a time-dependent dynamic component (perfusion). We achieve this via a dual-path architecture: a quantization-based path using a learnable embedding dictionary to extract consistent anatomical structures, and a probabilistic path using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to model dynamic enhancement conditioned on the estimated scan time. This design allows the network to hallucinate missing hemodynamic features by sampling from the learned latent distribution. Extensive experiments on a large-scale private abdominal CT dataset (2,282 cases) and two public datasets demonstrate that TARDis significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete modality frameworks. Notably, our method maintains robust diagnostic performance even in extreme data-sparsity scenarios, highlighting its potential for reducing radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic precision.</p></details> |  |

A promising direction is learning high-level, symbolic abstractions of the low-level skills of the agents, enabling reasoning and planning independent of the low-level state space. Among possible high-level representations, object-centric skill abstraction with symbolic predicates has been proven to be efficient because of its compatibility with domain-independent planners. Recent advances in foundation models have made it possible to generate symbolic predicates that operate on raw sensory inputs, a process we call generative predicate invention, to facilitate downstream abstraction learning. However, it remains unclear which formal properties the learned representations must satisfy, and how they can be learned to guarantee these properties. In this paper, we address both questions by presenting a formal theory of generative predicate invention for skill abstraction, resulting in symbolic operators that can be used for provably sound and complete planning. Within this framework, we propose SkillWrapper, a method that leverages foundation models to actively collect robot data and learn human-interpretable, plannable representations of black-box skills, using only RGB image observations. Our extensive empirical evaluation in simulation and on real robots shows that SkillWrapper learns abstract representations that enable solving unseen, long-horizon tasks in the real world with black-box skills.</p></details> |  |

While previous work has explored model-level and instance-level explainable graph learning, there has been limited investigation into explainable graph representation learning. In this paper, we focus on representation-level explainable graph learning and ask a fundamental question: What specific information about a graph is captured in graph representations? Our approach is inspired by graph kernels, which evaluate graph similarities by counting substructures within specific graph patterns. Although the pattern counting vector can serve as an explainable representation, it has limitations such as ignoring node features and being high-dimensional. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework (PXGL-GNN) for learning and explaining graph representations through graph pattern analysis. We start by sampling graph substructures of various patterns. Then, we learn the representations of these patterns and combine them using a weighted sum, where the weights indicate the importance of each graph pattern's contribution. We also provide theoretical analyses of our methods, including robustness and generalization. In our experiments, we show how to learn and explain graph representations for real-world data using pattern analysis. Additionally, we compare our method against multiple baselines in both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version with appendix of the paper published in the Proceedings of the Thirty-Fourth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-25), Main Track</p></details> |

While current methods mainly focus on learning modality-invariant features through unified embedding spaces, they often focus solely on the common discriminative semantics across modalities while disregarding the critical role of modality-specific identity-aware knowledge in discriminative feature learning. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Identity Clue Refinement and Enhancement (ICRE) network to mine and utilize the implicit discriminative knowledge inherent in modality-specific attributes. Initially, we design a Multi-Perception Feature Refinement (MPFR) module that aggregates shallow features from shared branches, aiming to capture modality-specific attributes that are easily overlooked. Then, we propose a Semantic Distillation Cascade Enhancement (SDCE) module, which distills identity-aware knowledge from the aggregated shallow features and guide the learning of modality-invariant features. Finally, an Identity Clues Guided (ICG) Loss is proposed to alleviate the modality discrepancies within the enhanced features and promote the learning of a diverse representation space. Extensive experiments across multiple public datasets clearly show that our proposed ICRE outperforms existing SOTA methods.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Boundary-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Zero-Shot Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04520v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the scarcity of annotated data and the substantial computational costs of model, conventional tuning methods in medical image segmentation face critical challenges. Current approaches to adapting pretrained models, including full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, still rely heavily on task-specific training on downstream tasks. Therefore, zero-shot segmentation has gained increasing attention, especially with foundation models such as SAM demonstrating promising generalization capabilities. However, SAM still faces notable limitations on medical datasets due to domain shifts, making efficient zero-shot enhancement an urgent research goal. To address these challenges, we propose BA-TTA-SAM, a task-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that significantly enhances the zero-shot segmentation performance of SAM via test-time adaptation. This framework integrates two key mechanisms: (1) The encoder-level Gaussian prompt injection embeds Gaussian-based prompts directly into the image encoder, providing explicit guidance for initial representation learning. (2) The cross-layer boundary-aware attention alignment exploits the hierarchical feature interactions within the ViT backbone, aligning deep semantic responses with shallow boundary cues. Experiments on four datasets, including ISIC, Kvasir, BUSI, and REFUGE, show an average improvement of 12.4\% in the DICE score compared with SAM's zero-shot segmentation performance. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in medical image segmentation. Our framework significantly enhances the generalization ability of SAM, without requiring any source-domain training data.

| **[BiTAgent: A Task-Aware Modular Framework for Bidirectional Coupling between Multimodal Large Language Models and World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04513v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building generalist embodied agents requires a unified system that can interpret multimodal goals, model environment dynamics, and execute reliable actions across diverse real-world tasks. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction. Extensive experiments across multi-task and cross-environment settings demonstrate superior stability and generalization over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a step toward open-ended embodied learning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space. Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE, achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages,13 figures,9 tables</p></details> |

Specifically, DeRA maintains a compact 1D latent space while factorizing video encoding into appearance and motion streams, which are aligned with pretrained vision foundation models to capture the spatial semantics and temporal dynamics in videos separately. To address the gradient conflicts introduced by the heterogeneous supervision, we further propose the Symmetric Alignment-Conflict Projection (SACP) module that proactively reformulates gradients by suppressing the components along conflicting directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeRA outperforms LARP, the previous state-of-the-art video tokenizer by 25% on UCF-101 in terms of rFVD. Moreover, using DeRA for autoregressive video generation, we also achieve new state-of-the-art results on both UCF-101 class-conditional generation and K600 frame prediction.</p></details> |  |

Humans perceive and interact with a fully 3D world, developing spatial awareness that extends beyond text-based understanding. However, most previous works learn from 1D text or 2D visual cues, such as bounding boxes, which inherently lack 3D understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoDTM, an Egocentric Depth- and Text-aware Model, jointly trained through large-scale 3D-aware video pretraining and video-text contrastive learning. EgoDTM incorporates a lightweight 3D-aware decoder to efficiently learn 3D-awareness from pseudo depth maps generated by depth estimation models. To further facilitate 3D-aware video pretraining, we enrich the original brief captions with hand-object visual cues by organically combining several foundation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate EgoDTM's superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, highlighting its superior 3D-aware visual understanding.

Recent results show that using mere observational data identifies the causal graph only up to a permutation-equivalence class. We obtain a combinatorial characterization of this class by showing that each graph in an equivalence class corresponds to a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. This bipartite representation allows us to analyze how interventions modify or constrain the matchings. Specifically, we show that each atomic intervention reveals one edge of the true matching and eliminates all incompatible causal graphs. Consequently, we formalize the optimal experiment design task as an adaptive stochastic optimization problem over the set of equivalence classes with a natural reward function that quantifies how many graphs are eliminated from the equivalence class by an intervention. We show that this reward function is adaptive submodular and provide a greedy policy with a provable near-optimal performance guarantee. A key technical challenge is to efficiently estimate the reward function without having to explicitly enumerate all the graphs in the equivalence class. We propose a sampling-based estimator using random matchings and analyze its bias and concentration behavior. Our simulation results show that performing a small number of interventions guided by our stochastic optimization framework recovers the true underlying causal structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Parkinsons Disease Gait Recognition Using Multimodal RGB-D Fusion and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04425v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and interpretable gait analysis plays a crucial role in the early detection of Parkinsons disease (PD),yet most existing approaches remain limited by single-modality inputs, low robustness, and a lack of clinical transparency. This paper presents an explainable multimodal framework that integrates RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data to recognize Parkinsonian gait patterns under realistic conditions. The proposed system employs dual YOLOv11-based encoders for modality-specific feature extraction, followed by a Multi-Scale Local-Global Extraction (MLGE) module and a Cross-Spatial Neck Fusion mechanism to enhance spatial-temporal representation. This design captures both fine-grained limb motion (e.g., reduced arm swing) and overall gait dynamics (e.g., short stride or turning difficulty), even in challenging scenarios such as low lighting or occlusion caused by clothing. To ensure interpretability, a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) is incorporated to translate fused visual embeddings and structured metadata into clinically meaningful textual explanations. Experimental evaluations on multimodal gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D fusion framework achieves higher recognition accuracy, improved robustness to environmental variations, and clear visual-linguistic reasoning compared with single-input baselines. By combining multimodal feature learning with language-based interpretability, this study bridges the gap between visual recognition and clinical understanding, offering a novel vision-language paradigm for reliable and explainable Parkinsons disease gait analysis.

| **[Geometric Multi-color Message Passing Graph Neural Networks for Blood-brain Barrier Permeability Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18926v4)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) is essential for central nervous system (CNS) drug development. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of 0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare, but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards 6G Native-AI Edge Networks: A Semantic-Aware and Agentic Intelligence Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04405v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution toward sixth-generation wireless systems positions intelligence as a native network capability, fundamentally transforming the design of radio access networks (RANs). Within this vision, Semantic-native communication and agentic intelligence are expected to play central roles. SemCom departs from bit-level fidelity and instead emphasizes task-oriented meaning exchange, enabling compact SC and introducing new performance measures such as semantic fidelity and task success rate. Agentic intelligence endows distributed RAN entities with goal-driven autonomy, reasoning, planning, and multi-agent collaboration, increasingly supported by foundation models and knowledge graphs. In this work, we first introduce the conceptual foundations of SemCom and agentic networking, and discuss why existing AI-driven O-RAN solutions remain largely bit-centric and task-siloed. We then present a unified taxonomy that organizes recent research along three axes: i) semantic abstraction level (symbol/feature/intent/knowledge), ii) agent autonomy and coordination granularity (single-, multi-, and hierarchical-agent), and iii) RAN control placement across PHY/MAC, near-real-time RIC, and non-real-time RIC. Based on this taxonomy, we systematically introduce enabling technologies including task-oriented semantic encoders/decoders, multi-agent reinforcement learning, foundation-model-assisted RAN agents, and knowledge-graph-based reasoning for cross-layer awareness. Representative 6G use cases, such as immersive XR, vehicular V2X, and industrial digital twins, are analyzed to illustrate the semantic-agentic convergence in practice. Finally, we identify open challenges in semantic representation standardization, scalable trustworthy agent coordination, O-RAN interoperability, and energy-efficient AI deployment, and outline research directions toward operational semantic-agentic AI-RAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Digital Communications and Networks</p></details> |

While recent studies focus on generating semantic and stylistic variations of given design concepts, functional coherence--the integration of multiple affordances into a single coherent concept--remains largely overlooked. In this paper, we introduce SYNTHIA, a framework for generating novel, functionally coherent designs based on desired affordances. Our approach leverages a hierarchical concept ontology that decomposes concepts into parts and affordances, serving as a crucial building block for functionally coherent design. We also develop a curriculum learning scheme based on our ontology that contrastively fine-tunes T2I models to progressively learn affordance composition while maintaining visual novelty. To elaborate, we (i) gradually increase affordance distance, guiding models from basic concept-affordance association to complex affordance compositions that integrate parts of distinct affordances into a single, coherent form, and (ii) enforce visual novelty by employing contrastive objectives to push learned representations away from existing concepts. Experimental results show that SYNTHIA outperforms state-of-the-art T2I models, demonstrating absolute gains of 25.1% and 14.7% for novelty and functional coherence in human evaluation, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main, Code is available https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/SYNTHIA</p></details> |
| **[Fourier-Attentive Representation Learning: A Fourier-Guided Framework for Few-Shot Generalization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04395v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong few-shot learning capabilities. However, these methods typically learn holistic representations where an image's domain-invariant structure is implicitly entangled with its domain-specific style. This presents an opportunity to further enhance generalization by disentangling these visual cues. In this paper, we propose Fourier-Attentive Representation Learning (FARL), a novel framework that addresses this by explicitly disentangling visual representations using Fourier analysis. The core of our method is a dual cross-attention mechanism, where learnable representation tokens separately query an image's structural features (from the phase spectrum) and stylistic features (from the amplitude spectrum). This process yields enriched, disentangled tokens that are then injected deep into the VLM encoders to guide adaptation. Our design, which includes an asymmetric injection strategy, forces the model to learn a more robust vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrap Dynamic-Aware 3D Visual Representation for Scalable Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00074v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite strong results on recognition and segmentation, current 3D visual pre-training methods often underperform on robotic manipulation. We attribute this gap to two factors: the lack of state-action-state dynamics modeling and the unnecessary redundancy of explicit geometric reconstruction. We introduce AFRO, a self-supervised framework that learns dynamics-aware 3D representations without action or reconstruction supervision. AFRO casts state prediction as a generative diffusion process and jointly models forward and inverse dynamics in a shared latent space to capture causal transition structure. To prevent feature leakage in action learning, we employ feature differencing and inverse-consistency supervision, improving the quality and stability of visual features. When combined with Diffusion Policy, AFRO substantially increases manipulation success rates across 16 simulated and 4 real-world tasks, outperforming existing pre-training approaches. The framework also scales favorably with data volume and task complexity. Qualitative visualizations indicate that AFRO learns semantically rich, discriminative features, offering an effective pre-training solution for 3D representation learning in robotics.

These complexities often limit the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this, we propose DE-KAN, a novel Dual Encoder Kolmogorov Arnold Network, which enhances feature representation and segmentation precision. The framework employs a ResNet-18 encoder for augmented inputs and a customized CNN encoder for original inputs, enabling the complementary extraction of global and local spatial features. These features are fused through KAN-based bottleneck layers, incorporating nonlinear learnable activation functions derived from the Kolmogorov Arnold representation theorem to improve learning capacity and interpretability. Extensive experiments on two benchmark dental X-ray datasets demonstrate that DE-KAN outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation models, achieving mIoU of 94.5%, Dice coefficient of 97.1%, accuracy of 98.91%, and recall of 97.36%, representing up to +4.7% improvement in Dice compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LangSAT: A Novel Framework Combining NLP and Reinforcement Learning for SAT Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04374v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our work presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to optimize heuristic selection within the conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) process, improving the efficiency of Boolean satisfia- bility (SAT) solving. The proposed system, LangSAT, bridges the gap between natural language inputs and propositional logic by converting English descriptions into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) expressions and solving them using an RL-enhanced CDCL SAT solver. Unlike existing SAT-solving platforms that require CNF as input, LangSAT enables users to input standard English descriptions, making SAT-solving more accessible. The framework comprises two key components: Lang2Logic, which translates English sentences into CNF expressions, and SmartSAT, an RL-based SAT solver. SmartSAT encodes clause-variable relationships as structured graph representations and extracts global features specific to the SAT problem. This implementation provides the RL agent with deeper contextual information, enabling SAT problems to be solved more efficiently. Lang2Logic was evaluated on diverse natural language inputs, processing descriptions up to 450 words. The generated CNFs were solved by SmartSAT, which demonstrated comparable performance to traditional CDCL heuristics with respect to solving time. The combined LangSAT framework offers a more accessible and scalable solution for SAT-solving tasks across reasoning, formal verification, and debugging.</p></details> |  |

What mechanisms underlie such efficient developmental learning in humans? This study investigates this question through robot simulation experiments in which agents learn to perform actions associated with imperative sentences (e.g., \textit{push red cube}) via curiosity-driven self-exploration. Our approach integrates the active inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling intrinsically motivated developmental learning. The simulations reveal several key findings: i) Generalization improves markedly as the scale of compositional elements increases. ii) Curiosity combined with motor noise yields substantially better learning than exploration without curiosity. iii) Rote pairing of sentences and actions precedes the emergence of compositional generalization. iv) Simpler, prerequisite-like actions develop earlier than more complex actions that depend on them. v) When exception-handling rules were introduced -- where certain imperative sentences required executing inconsistent actions -- the robots successfully acquired these exceptions through exploration and displayed a U-shaped performance curve characteristic of representational redescription in child language learning. Together, these results suggest that curiosity-driven exploration and active inference provide a powerful account of how intrinsic motivation and hierarchical sensorimotor learning can jointly support scalable compositional generalization and exception handling in both humans and artificial agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 19 pages of supplementary material</p></details> |
| **[Training-Free Active Learning Framework in Materials Science with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19730v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning (AL) accelerates scientific discovery by prioritizing the most informative experiments, but traditional machine learning (ML) models used in AL suffer from cold-start limitations and domain-specific feature engineering, restricting their generalizability. Large language models (LLMs) offer a new paradigm by leveraging their pretrained knowledge and universal token-based representations to propose experiments directly from text-based descriptions. Here, we introduce an LLM-based active learning framework (LLM-AL) that operates in an iterative few-shot setting and benchmark it against conventional ML models across four diverse materials science datasets. We explored two prompting strategies: one using concise numerical inputs suited for datasets with more compositional and structured features, and another using expanded descriptive text suited for datasets with more experimental and procedural features to provide additional context. Across all datasets, LLM-AL could reduce the number of experiments needed to reach top-performing candidates by over 70% and consistently outperformed traditional ML models. We found that LLM-AL performs broader and more exploratory searches while still reaching the optima with fewer iterations. We further examined the stability boundaries of LLM-AL given the inherent non-determinism of LLMs and found its performance to be broadly consistent across runs, within the variability range typically observed for traditional ML approaches. These results demonstrate that LLM-AL can serve as a generalizable alternative to conventional AL pipelines for more efficient and interpretable experiment selection and potential LLM-driven autonomous discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[DisentangleFormer: Spatial-Channel Decoupling for Multi-Channel Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04314v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers face a fundamental limitation: standard self-attention jointly processes spatial and channel dimensions, leading to entangled representations that prevent independent modeling of structural and semantic dependencies. This problem is especially pronounced in hyperspectral imaging, from satellite hyperspectral remote sensing to infrared pathology imaging, where channels capture distinct biophysical or biochemical cues. We propose DisentangleFormer, an architecture that achieves robust multi-channel vision representation through principled spatial-channel decoupling. Motivated by information-theoretic principles of decorrelated representation learning, our parallel design enables independent modeling of structural and semantic cues while minimizing redundancy between spatial and channel streams. Our design integrates three core components: (1) Parallel Disentanglement: Independently processes spatial-token and channel-token streams, enabling decorrelated feature learning across spatial and spectral dimensions, (2) Squeezed Token Enhancer: An adaptive calibration module that dynamically fuses spatial and channel streams, and (3) Multi-Scale FFN: complementing global attention with multi-scale local context to capture fine-grained structural and semantic dependencies. Extensive experiments on hyperspectral benchmarks demonstrate that DisentangleFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing models on Indian Pine, Pavia University, and Houston, the large-scale BigEarthNet remote sensing dataset, as well as an infrared pathology dataset. Moreover, it retains competitive accuracy on ImageNet while reducing computational cost by 17.8% in FLOPs. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Hence, a long line of work has focused on mathematically characterising the geometry of such "neural representations." In parallel, machine learning has seen a surge of interest in understanding how dynamical systems perform computations on time-varying input data. Yet, the link between computation-through-dynamics and representational geometry remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesise that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) perform computations by dynamically warping their representations of task variables. To test this hypothesis, we develop a Riemannian geometric framework that enables the derivation of the manifold topology and geometry of a dynamical system from the manifold of its inputs. By characterising the time-varying geometry of RNNs, we show that dynamic warping is a fundamental feature of their computations.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

These models have shown strong potential in generalization and reasoning, but achieving reliable and responsible robotic behavior in real-world settings remains an open challenge. In high-stakes environments, robotic agents must go beyond basic task execution to perform risk-aware reasoning, moral decision-making, and physically grounded planning. We introduce ResponsibleRobotBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate and accelerate progress in responsible robotic manipulation from simulation to real world. This benchmark consists of 23 multi-stage tasks spanning diverse risk types, including electrical, chemical, and human-related hazards, and varying levels of physical and planning complexity. These tasks require agents to detect and mitigate risks, reason about safety, plan sequences of actions, and engage human assistance when necessary. Our benchmark includes a general-purpose evaluation framework that supports multimodal model-based agents with various action representation modalities. The framework integrates visual perception, context learning, prompt construction, hazard detection, reasoning and planning, and physical execution. It also provides a rich multimodal dataset, supports reproducible experiments, and includes standardized metrics such as success rate, safety rate, and safe success rate. Through extensive experimental setups, ResponsibleRobotBench enables analysis across risk categories, task types, and agent configurations. By emphasizing physical reliability, generalization, and safety in decision-making, this benchmark provides a foundation for advancing the development of trustworthy, real-world responsible dexterous robotic systems. https://sites.google.com/view/responsible-robotbench</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://sites.google.com/view/responsible-robotbench</p></details> |

However, conventional monocular depth estimation often oversmooths these features, losing critical information for motion planning and stability. To address this, we introduce Gamma-from-Mono (GfM), a lightweight monocular geometry estimation method that resolves the projective ambiguity in single-camera reconstruction by decoupling global and local structure. GfM predicts a dominant road surface plane together with residual variations expressed by gamma, a dimensionless measure of vertical deviation from the plane, defined as the ratio of a point's height above it to its depth from the camera, and grounded in established planar parallax geometry. With only the camera's height above ground, this representation deterministically recovers metric depth via a closed form, avoiding full extrinsic calibration and naturally prioritizing near-road detail. Its physically interpretable formulation makes it well suited for self-supervised learning, eliminating the need for large annotated datasets. Evaluated on KITTI and the Road Surface Reconstruction Dataset (RSRD), GfM achieves state-of-the-art near-field accuracy in both depth and gamma estimation while maintaining competitive global depth performance. Our lightweight 8.88M-parameter model adapts robustly across diverse camera setups and, to our knowledge, is the first self-supervised monocular approach evaluated on RSRD.</p></details> | Accepted in 3DV 2026 |

We introduce GRASP - GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization - a lightweight PEFT framework that partitions the D-dimensional token representations of selected layers into K << D groups and learns a shared scaling and shifting vector for each group. This grouped modulation reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly while preserving the ability of the model to learn task-specific features. Building on this formulation, we further propose StochGRASP, which learns Gaussian distributions as perturbations to the pre-trained weights rather than deterministic values. This probabilistic parameterization along with a noise-aware loss function formulation enables modelling hardware-level variability in programmed weights and significantly improves robustness under non-ideal inference conditions-an important requirement for deployment on edge-based emerging AI hardware. Across GLUE (RoBERTa-base & RoBERTa-large) and E2E NLG (GPT-2 Medium), GRASP matches or exceeds the performance of established PEFT methods while achieving an order of magnitude reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA and BitFit. Under varying levels of noise, StochGRASP consistently outperforms deterministic variants, demonstrating its suitability for energy-efficient and noise-prone hardware platforms.</p></details> | Under Review |

Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning. Yet, existing frequent or discriminative subgraph mining approaches often suffer from redundant multi-phase pipelines, high computational cost, and weak coupling between mined structures and their discriminative relevance. We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that DS-Span generates more compact and discriminative subgraph features than prior multi-stage methods, achieving higher or comparable accuracy with significantly reduced runtime. These results highlight the potential of unified, single-phase discriminative mining as a foundation for scalable and interpretable graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistency-based Abductive Reasoning over Perceptual Errors of Multiple Pre-trained Models in Novel Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19361v4)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem, building on the idea of abductive learning (ABL) but applying it to test-time instead of training. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6\% in F1-score and 16.6\% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect models in challenging, novel scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The architecture you train with is the architecture you deploy. This assumption constrains the community from selecting architectures that may have desirable efficiency or design properties due to difficulties with optimization. We challenge this assumption with Network of Theseus (NoT), a method for progressively converting a trained, or even untrained, guide network architecture part-by-part into an entirely different target network architecture while preserving the performance of the guide network. At each stage, components in the guide network architecture are incrementally replaced with target architecture modules and aligned via representational similarity metrics. This procedure largely preserves the functionality of the guide network even under substantial architectural changes-for example, converting a convolutional network into a multilayer perceptron, or GPT-2 into a recurrent neural network. By decoupling optimization from deployment, NoT expands the space of viable inference-time architectures, opening opportunities for better accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs and enabling more directed exploration of the architectural design space.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 24 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Unique Lives, Shared World: Learning from Single-Life Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04085v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the "single-life" learning paradigm, where we train a distinct vision model exclusively on egocentric videos captured by one individual. We leverage the multiple viewpoints naturally captured within a single life to learn a visual encoder in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate three key findings. First, models trained independently on different lives develop a highly aligned geometric understanding. We demonstrate this by training visual encoders on distinct datasets each capturing a different life, both indoors and outdoors, as well as introducing a novel cross-attention-based metric to quantify the functional alignment of the internal representations developed by different models. Second, we show that single-life models learn generalizable geometric representations that effectively transfer to downstream tasks, such as depth estimation, in unseen environments. Third, we demonstrate that training on up to 30 hours from one week of the same person's life leads to comparable performance to training on 30 hours of diverse web data, highlighting the strength of single-life representation learning. Overall, our results establish that the shared structure of the world, both leads to consistency in models trained on individual lives, and provides a powerful signal for visual representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimFlow: Simplified and End-to-End Training of Latent Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04084v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normalizing Flows (NFs) learn invertible mappings between the data and a Gaussian distribution. Prior works usually suffer from two limitations. First, they add random noise to training samples or VAE latents as data augmentation, introducing complex pipelines including extra noising and denoising steps. Second, they use a pretrained and frozen VAE encoder, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction and generation quality. In this paper, we find that the two issues can be solved in a very simple way: just fixing the variance (which would otherwise be predicted by the VAE encoder) to a constant (e.g., 0.5). On the one hand, this method allows the encoder to output a broader distribution of tokens and the decoder to learn to reconstruct clean images from the augmented token distribution, avoiding additional noise or denoising design. On the other hand, fixed variance simplifies the VAE evidence lower bound, making it stable to train an NF with a VAE jointly. On the ImageNet $256 \times 256$ generation task, our model SimFlow obtains a gFID score of 2.15, outperforming the state-of-the-art method STARFlow (gFID 2.40). Moreover, SimFlow can be seamlessly integrated with the end-to-end representation alignment (REPA-E) method and achieves an improved gFID of 1.91, setting a new state of the art among NFs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://qinyu-allen-zhao.github.io/SimFlow/</p></details> |
| **[NVRC: Neural Video Representation Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07414v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in implicit neural representation (INR)-based video coding have demonstrated its potential to compete with both conventional and other learning-based approaches. With INR methods, a neural network is trained to overfit a video sequence, with its parameters compressed to obtain a compact representation of the video content. However, although promising results have been achieved, the best INR-based methods are still out-performed by the latest standard codecs, such as VVC VTM, partially due to the simple model compression techniques employed. In this paper, rather than focusing on representation architectures as in many existing works, we propose a novel INR-based video compression framework, Neural Video Representation Compression (NVRC), targeting compression of the representation. Based on the novel entropy coding and quantization models proposed, NVRC, for the first time, is able to optimize an INR-based video codec in a fully end-to-end manner. To further minimize the additional bitrate overhead introduced by the entropy models, we have also proposed a new model compression framework for coding all the network, quantization and entropy model parameters hierarchically. Our experiments show that NVRC outperforms many conventional and learning-based benchmark codecs, with a 24% average coding gain over VVC VTM (Random Access) on the UVG dataset, measured in PSNR. As far as we are aware, this is the first time an INR-based video codec achieving such performance. The implementation of NVRC will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain Feature Collapse: Implications for Out-of-Distribution Detection and Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04034v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Why do state-of-the-art OOD detection methods exhibit catastrophic failure when models are trained on single-domain datasets? We provide the first theoretical explanation for this phenomenon through the lens of information theory. We prove that supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably produces domain feature collapse -- representations where I(x_d; z) = 0, meaning domain-specific information is completely discarded. This is a fundamental consequence of information bottleneck optimization: models trained on single domains (e.g., medical images) learn to rely solely on class-specific features while discarding domain features, leading to catastrophic failure when detecting out-of-domain samples (e.g., achieving only 53% FPR@95 on MNIST). We extend our analysis using Fano's inequality to quantify partial collapse in practical scenarios. To validate our theory, we introduce Domain Bench, a benchmark of single-domain datasets, and demonstrate that preserving I(x_d; z) > 0 through domain filtering (using pretrained representations) resolves the failure mode. While domain filtering itself is conceptually straightforward, its effectiveness provides strong empirical evidence for our information-theoretic framework. Our work explains a puzzling empirical phenomenon, reveals fundamental limitations of supervised learning in narrow domains, and has broader implications for transfer learning and when to fine-tune versus freeze pretrained models.</p></details> |  |
| **[C3G: Learning Compact 3D Representations with 2K Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04021v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing and understanding 3D scenes from unposed sparse views in a feed-forward manner remains as a challenging task in 3D computer vision. Recent approaches use per-pixel 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction, followed by a 2D-to-3D feature lifting stage for scene understanding. However, they generate excessive redundant Gaussians, causing high memory overhead and sub-optimal multi-view feature aggregation, leading to degraded novel view synthesis and scene understanding performance. We propose C3G, a novel feed-forward framework that estimates compact 3D Gaussians only at essential spatial locations, minimizing redundancy while enabling effective feature lifting. We introduce learnable tokens that aggregate multi-view features through self-attention to guide Gaussian generation, ensuring each Gaussian integrates relevant visual features across views. We then exploit the learned attention patterns for Gaussian decoding to efficiently lift features. Extensive experiments on pose-free novel view synthesis, 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, and view-invariant feature aggregation demonstrate our approach's effectiveness. Results show that a compact yet geometrically meaningful representation is sufficient for high-quality scene reconstruction and understanding, achieving superior memory efficiency and feature fidelity compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page : https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/C3G/</p></details> |
| **[Learning Group Actions In Disentangled Latent Image Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04015v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling group actions on latent representations enables controllable transformations of high-dimensional image data. Prior works applying group-theoretic priors or modeling transformations typically operate in the high-dimensional data space, where group actions apply uniformly across the entire input, making it difficult to disentangle the subspace that varies under transformations. While latent-space methods offer greater flexibility, they still require manual partitioning of latent variables into equivariant and invariant subspaces, limiting the ability to robustly learn and operate group actions within the representation space. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework that for the first time learns group actions on latent image manifolds, automatically discovering transformation-relevant structures without manual intervention. Our method uses learnable binary masks with straight-through estimation to dynamically partition latent representations into transformation-sensitive and invariant components. We formulate this within a unified optimization framework that jointly learns latent disentanglement and group transformation mappings. The framework can be seamlessly integrated with any standard encoder-decoder architecture. We validate our approach on five 2D/3D image datasets, demonstrating its ability to automatically learn disentangled latent factors for group actions in diverse data, while downstream classification tasks confirm the effectiveness of the learned representations. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/farhanaswarnali/Learning-Group-Actions-In-Disentangled-Latent-Image-Representations .</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Temporality for Sketch Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04007v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sketches are simple human hand-drawn abstractions of complex scenes and real-world objects. Although the field of sketch representation learning has advanced significantly, there is still a gap in understanding the true relevance of the temporal aspect to the quality of these representations. This work investigates whether it is indeed justifiable to treat sketches as sequences, as well as which internal orders play a more relevant role. The results indicate that, although the use of traditional positional encodings is valid for modeling sketches as sequences, absolute coordinates consistently outperform relative ones. Furthermore, non-autoregressive decoders outperform their autoregressive counterparts. Finally, the importance of temporality was shown to depend on both the order considered and the task evaluated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximate Optimal Active Learning of Decision Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03971v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of actively learning an unknown binary decision tree using only membership queries, a setting in which the learner must reason about a large hypothesis space while maintaining formal guarantees. Rather than enumerating candidate trees or relying on heuristic impurity or entropy measures, we encode the entire space of bounded-depth decision trees symbolically in SAT formulas. We propose a symbolic method for active learning of decision trees, in which approximate model counting is used to estimate the reduction of the hypothesis space caused by each potential query, enabling near-optimal query selection without full model enumeration. The resulting learner incrementally strengthens a CNF representation based on observed query outcomes, and approximate model counter ApproxMC is invoked to quantify the remaining version space in a sound and scalable manner. Additionally, when ApproxMC stagnates, a functional equivalence check is performed to verify that all remaining hypotheses are functionally identical. Experiments on decision trees show that the method reliably converges to the correct model using only a handful of queries, while retaining a rigorous SAT-based foundation suitable for formal analysis and verification.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an asynchronous FL design with periodic aggregation to tackle the straggler issue in FL systems. Considering limited wireless communication resources, we investigate the effect of different scheduling policies and aggregation designs on the convergence performance. Driven by the importance of reducing the bias and variance of the aggregated model updates, we propose a scheduling policy that jointly considers the channel quality and training data representation of user devices. The effectiveness of our channel-aware data-importance-based scheduling policy, compared with state-of-the-art methods proposed for synchronous FL, is validated through simulations. Moreover, we show that an ``age-aware'' aggregation weighting design can significantly improve the learning performance in an asynchronous FL setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>An am...</summary><p>An amended (corrected) version of the refereed paper published in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications</p></details> |
| **[Exploring the Potentials of Spiking Neural Networks for Image Deraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02258v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.</p></details> | Accepted By AAAI2026 |

However, objectively accurate methods to early detect local regrowth (LR) from follow-up endoscopy images during WW are essential to manage care and prevent distant metastases. Hence, we developed a Siamese Swin Transformer with Dual Cross-Attention (SSDCA) to combine longitudinal endoscopic images at restaging and follow-up and distinguish cCR from LR. SSDCA leverages pretrained Swin transformers to extract domain agnostic features and enhance robustness to imaging variations. Dual cross attention is implemented to emphasize features from the two scans without requiring any spatial alignment of images to predict response. SSDCA as well as Swin-based baselines were trained using image pairs from 135 patients and evaluated on a held-out set of image pairs from 62 patients. SSDCA produced the best balanced accuracy (81.76\% $\pm$ 0.04), sensitivity (90.07\% $\pm$ 0.08), and specificity (72.86\% $\pm$ 0.05). Robustness analysis showed stable performance irrespective of artifacts including blood, stool, telangiectasia, and poor image quality. UMAP clustering of extracted features showed maximal inter-cluster separation (1.45 $\pm$ 0.18) and minimal intra-cluster dispersion (1.07 $\pm$ 0.19) with SSDCA, confirming discriminative representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, submitted to ISBI conference</p></details> |

No existing framework unifies these objectives within a single architecture while retaining generalization across imaging modalities and datasets. We introduce PULSE, a multi-task vision-language framework built on self-supervised representations and optimized through a composite supervision strategy that balances region overlap learning, pixel wise classification fidelity, and boundary aware IoU refinement. A multi-scale token reconstruction decoder enables anatomical segmentation, while shared global representations support disease classification and clinically grounded text output allowing the model to transition from pixels to structures and finally clinical reasoning within one architecture. Unlike prior task-specific pipelines, PULSE learns task-invariant cardiac priors, generalizes robustly across datasets, and can be adapted to new imaging modalities with minimal supervision. This moves the field closer to a scalable, foundation style cardiac analysis framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Common Pipeline for Harmonizing Electronic Health Record Data for Translational Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08553v3)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the growing availability of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, researchers often face substantial barriers in effectively using these data for translational research due to their complexity, heterogeneity, and lack of standardized tools and documentation. To address this critical gap, we introduce PEHRT, a common pipeline for harmonizing EHR data for translational research. PEHRT is a comprehensive, ready-to-use resource that includes open-source code, visualization tools, and detailed documentation to streamline the process of preparing EHR data for analysis. The pipeline provides tools to harmonize structured and unstructured EHR data to standardized ontologies to ensure consistency across diverse coding systems. In the presence of unmapped or heterogeneous local codes, PEHRT further leverages representation learning and pre-trained language models to generate robust embeddings that capture semantic relationships across sites to mitigate heterogeneity and enable integrative downstream analyses. PEHRT also supports cross-institutional co-training through shared representations, allowing participating sites to collaboratively refine embeddings and enhance generalizability without sharing individual-level data. The framework is data model-agnostic and can be seamlessly deployed across diverse healthcare systems to produce interoperable, research-ready datasets. By lowering the technical barriers to EHR-based research, PEHRT empowers investigators to transform raw clinical data into reproducible, analysis-ready resources for discovery and innovation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training and Evaluation of Guideline-Based Medical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03838v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.</p></details> |  |
| **[MPCFormer: A physics-informed data-driven approach for explainable socially-aware autonomous driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03795v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Driving (AD) vehicles still struggle to exhibit human-like behavior in highly dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios. The key challenge lies in AD's limited ability to interact with surrounding vehicles, largely due to a lack of understanding the underlying mechanisms of social interaction. To address this issue, we introduce MPCFormer, an explainable socially-aware autonomous driving approach with physics-informed and data-driven coupled social interaction dynamics. In this model, the dynamics are formulated into a discrete space-state representation, which embeds physics priors to enhance modeling explainability. The dynamics coefficients are learned from naturalistic driving data via a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture. To the best of our knowledge, MPCFormer is the first approach to explicitly model the dynamics of multi-vehicle social interactions. The learned social interaction dynamics enable the planner to generate manifold, human-like behaviors when interacting with surrounding traffic. By leveraging the MPC framework, the approach mitigates the potential safety risks typically associated with purely learning-based methods. Open-looped evaluation on NGSIM dataset demonstrates that MPCFormer achieves superior social interaction awareness, yielding the lowest trajectory prediction errors compared with other state-of-the-art approach. The prediction achieves an ADE as low as 0.86 m over a long prediction horizon of 5 seconds. Close-looped experiments in highly intense interaction scenarios, where consecutive lane changes are required to exit an off-ramp, further validate the effectiveness of MPCFormer. Results show that MPCFormer achieves the highest planning success rate of 94.67%, improves driving efficiency by 15.75%, and reduces the collision rate from 21.25% to 0.5%, outperforming a frontier Reinforcement Learning (RL) based planner.</p></details> | 17 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Delving into Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency for Robust 3D Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11323v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Three gaps persist: (1) lack of joint training that integrates spatial and temporal representations, (2) origin-agnostic treatment that ignores directional asymmetries in navigation ($A \to B \ne B \to A$), and (3) over-reliance on auxiliary data (POIs, imagery) rather than fundamental geometric properties of urban space. We introduce a conditional trajectory encoder that jointly learns spatial and movement representations while preserving origin-dependent asymmetries using geometric features. This framework decomposes urban navigation into shared cognitive patterns and origin-specific spatial narratives, enabling quantitative measurement of cognitive asymmetries across starting locations. Our bidirectional LSTM processes visibility ratio and curvature features conditioned on learnable origin embeddings, decomposing representations into shared urban patterns and origin-specific signatures through contrastive learning. Results from six synthetic cities and real-world validation on Beijing's Xicheng District demonstrate that urban morphology creates systematic cognitive inequalities. This provides urban planners quantitative tools for assessing experiential equity, offers architects insights into layout decisions' cognitive impacts, and enables origin-aware analytics for navigation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universally Converging Representations of Matter Across Scientific Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03750v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models of vastly different modalities and architectures are being trained to predict the behavior of molecules, materials, and proteins. However, it remains unclear whether they learn similar internal representations of matter. Understanding their latent structure is essential for building scientific foundation models that generalize reliably beyond their training domains. Although representational convergence has been observed in language and vision, its counterpart in the sciences has not been systematically explored. Here, we show that representations learned by nearly sixty scientific models, spanning string-, graph-, 3D atomistic, and protein-based modalities, are highly aligned across a wide range of chemical systems. Models trained on different datasets have highly similar representations of small molecules, and machine learning interatomic potentials converge in representation space as they improve in performance, suggesting that foundation models learn a common underlying representation of physical reality. We then show two distinct regimes of scientific models: on inputs similar to those seen during training, high-performing models align closely and weak models diverge into local sub-optima in representation space; on vastly different structures from those seen during training, nearly all models collapse onto a low-information representation, indicating that today's models remain limited by training data and inductive bias and do not yet encode truly universal structure. Our findings establish representational alignment as a quantitative benchmark for foundation-level generality in scientific models. More broadly, our work can track the emergence of universal representations of matter as models scale, and for selecting and distilling models whose learned representations transfer best across modalities, domains of matter, and scientific tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral spotlight at NeurIPS 2025 UniReps Workshop</p></details> |

Existing approaches cannot distinguish between true recovery and "false recovery," where traffic metrics normalize, but the underlying system dynamics permanently degrade. To address this, a new physics-constrained Hamiltonian learning algorithm combining "structural irreversibility detection" and "energy landscape reconstruction" has been developed. Our approach extracts low-dimensional state representations, identifies quasi-Hamiltonian structures through physics-constrained optimization, and quantifies structural changes via energy landscape comparison. Analysis of London's extreme rainfall in 2021 demonstrates that while surface indicators were fully recovered, our algorithm detected 64.8\% structural damage missed by traditional monitoring. Our framework provides tools for proactive structural risk assessment, enabling infrastructure investments based on true system health rather than misleading surface metrics.</p></details> |  |

Existing text-to-3D stylization methods typically distill from 2D image editors, requiring time-intensive per-asset optimization and exhibiting multi-view inconsistency due to the limitations of current text-to-image models, which makes them impractical for large-scale production. In this paper, we introduce GaussianBlender, a pioneering feed-forward framework for text-driven 3D stylization that performs edits instantly at inference. Our method learns structured, disentangled latent spaces with controlled information sharing for geometry and appearance from spatially-grouped 3D Gaussians. A latent diffusion model then applies text-conditioned edits on these learned representations. Comprehensive evaluations show that GaussianBlender not only delivers instant, high-fidelity, geometry-preserving, multi-view consistent stylization, but also surpasses methods that require per-instance test-time optimization - unlocking practical, democratized 3D stylization at scale.</p></details> |  |

Static models assume fixed mappings to ensure generalization, whereas adaptive models may overfit to transient patterns, creating a dilemma between robustness and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze key factors essential for constructing an effective dynamic mapping for temporal tabular data. We discover that evolving feature semantics-particularly objective and subjective meanings-introduce concept drift over time. Crucially, we identify that feature transformation strategies are able to mitigate discrepancies in feature representations across temporal stages. Motivated by these insights, we propose a feature-aware temporal modulation mechanism that conditions feature representations on temporal context, modulating statistical properties such as scale and skewness. By aligning feature semantics across time, our approach achieves a lightweight yet powerful adaptation, effectively balancing generalizability and adaptability. Benchmark evaluations validate the effectiveness of our method in handling temporal shifts in tabular data.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables.

However, their performance often deteriorates under temporal distribution shifts, where trends and periodic patterns are present in the evolving data distribution over time. In this paper, we explore the underlying reasons for this failure in capturing temporal dependencies. We begin by investigating the training protocol, revealing a key issue in how model selection performs. While existing approaches use temporal ordering for splitting validation set, we show that even a random split can significantly improve model performance. By minimizing the time lag between training data and test time, while reducing the bias in validation, our proposed training protocol significantly improves generalization across various methods. Furthermore, we analyze how temporal data affects deep tabular representations, uncovering that these models often fail to capture crucial periodic and trend information. To address this gap, we introduce a plug-and-play temporal embedding method based on Fourier series expansion to learn and incorporate temporal patterns, offering an adaptive approach to handle temporal shifts. Our experiments demonstrate that this temporal embedding, combined with the improved training protocol, provides a more effective and robust framework for learning from temporal tabular data.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 figures, 13 tables.

| **[Cyclical Temporal Encoding and Hybrid Deep Ensembles for Multistep Energy Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03656v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is essential for demand management and smart grid operations. This paper introduces a unified deep learning framework that integrates cyclical temporal encoding with hybrid LSTM-CNN architectures to enhance multistep energy forecasting. We systematically transform calendar-based attributes using sine cosine encodings to preserve periodic structure and evaluate their predictive relevance through correlation analysis. To exploit both long-term seasonal effects and short-term local patterns, we employ an ensemble model composed of an LSTM, a CNN, and a meta-learner of MLP regressors specialized for each forecast horizon. Using a one year national consumption dataset, we conduct an extensive experimental study including ablation analyses with and without cyclical encodings and calendar features and comparisons with established baselines from the literature. Results demonstrate consistent improvements across all seven forecast horizons, with our hybrid model achieving lower RMSE and MAE than individual architectures and prior methods. These findings confirm the benefit of combining cyclical temporal representations with complementary deep learning structures. To our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly evaluate temporal encodings, calendar-based features, and hybrid ensemble architectures within a unified short-term energy forecasting framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optical Context Compression Is Just (Bad) Autoencoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03643v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DeepSeek-OCR demonstrates that rendered text can be reconstructed with high fidelity from a small number of vision tokens. This finding has sparked excitement about vision-based context compression for language models. But the evaluation stops at reconstruction; whether these representations help language modeling remains untested. We test two assumptions implicit in the optical-compression narrative: that vision-based compression provides unique advantages for text reconstruction from compressed representations, and that DeepSeek-OCR's reconstruction results are evidence that vision-based compression will be useful for language modeling. Comparing their vision encoder against simple alternatives--parameter-free mean pooling and a learned hierarchical encoder--we find that these simple approaches match or surpass vision for reconstruction at matched compression ratios, and outperform it for language modeling--where vision-based compression fails to beat truncation. The excitement around optical context compression outpaces the evidence. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/ivnle/bad-autoencoding</p></details> |  |
| **[Covariance Scattering Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08878v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AaPE: Aliasing-aware Patch Embedding for Self-Supervised Audio Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03637v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based audio SSL (self-supervised learning) models often treat spectrograms as images, applying convolutional patchification with heavy temporal downsampling. This lowers the effective Nyquist frequency and introduces aliasing, while naïve low-pass filtering removes task-relevant high-frequency cues. In this study, we present Aliasing-aware Patch Embedding (AaPE), a drop-in patch stem that mitigates aliasing while preserving high-frequency information. AaPE augments standard patch tokens with features produced by a band-limited complex sinusoidal kernel using a two-sided exponential window that dynamically targets alias-prone bands. Frequency and decay parameters of the kernel are estimated from the input, enabling parallel, adaptive subband analysis whose outputs are fused with the standard patch tokens. AaPE integrates seamlessly into the masked teacher-student self-supervised learning. In addition, we combine a multi-mask strategy with a contrastive objective to enforce consistency across diverse mask patterns, stabilizing training. Pre-training on AudioSet followed by fine-tuning evaluation across diverse downstream benchmarks, which spanned categories, such as environmental sounds and other common audio domains. This approach yields state-of-the-art performance on a subset of tasks and competitive results across the remainder. Complementary linear probing evaluation mirrors this pattern, yielding clear gains on several benchmarks and strong performance elsewhere. The collective analysis of these results indicates that AaPE serves to mitigate the effects of aliasing without discarding of informative high-frequency content.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[DynamicCity: Large-Scale 4D Occupancy Generation from Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18084v3)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban scene generation has been developing rapidly recently. However, existing methods primarily focus on generating static and single-frame scenes, overlooking the inherently dynamic nature of real-world driving environments. In this work, we introduce DynamicCity, a novel 4D occupancy generation framework capable of generating large-scale, high-quality dynamic 4D scenes with semantics. DynamicCity mainly consists of two key models. 1) A VAE model for learning HexPlane as the compact 4D representation. Instead of using naive averaging operations, DynamicCity employs a novel Projection Module to effectively compress 4D features into six 2D feature maps for HexPlane construction, which significantly enhances HexPlane fitting quality (up to 12.56 mIoU gain). Furthermore, we utilize an Expansion & Squeeze Strategy to reconstruct 3D feature volumes in parallel, which improves both network training efficiency and reconstruction accuracy than naively querying each 3D point (up to 7.05 mIoU gain, 2.06x training speedup, and 70.84% memory reduction). 2) A DiT-based diffusion model for HexPlane generation. To make HexPlane feasible for DiT generation, a Padded Rollout Operation is proposed to reorganize all six feature planes of the HexPlane as a squared 2D feature map. In particular, various conditions could be introduced in the diffusion or sampling process, supporting versatile 4D generation applications, such as trajectory- and command-driven generation, inpainting, and layout-conditioned generation. Extensive experiments on the CarlaSC and Waymo datasets demonstrate that DynamicCity significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D occupancy generation methods across multiple metrics. The code and models have been released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Spotlight; 35 pages, 18 figures, 15 tables; Project Page at https://dynamic-city.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Observation-driven correction of numerical weather prediction for marine winds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03606v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate marine wind forecasts are essential for safe navigation, ship routing, and energy operations, yet they remain challenging because observations over the ocean are sparse, heterogeneous, and temporally variable. We reformulate wind forecasting as observation-informed correction of a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Rather than forecasting winds directly, we learn local correction patterns by assimilating the latest in-situ observations to adjust the Global Forecast System (GFS) output. We propose a transformer-based deep learning architecture that (i) handles irregular and time-varying observation sets through masking and set-based attention mechanisms, (ii) conditions predictions on recent observation-forecast pairs via cross-attention, and (iii) employs cyclical time embeddings and coordinate-aware location representations to enable single-pass inference at arbitrary spatial coordinates. We evaluate our model over the Atlantic Ocean using observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) as reference. The model reduces GFS 10-meter wind RMSE at all lead times up to 48 hours, achieving 45% improvement at 1-hour lead time and 13% improvement at 48-hour lead time. Spatial analyses reveal the most persistent improvements along coastlines and shipping routes, where observations are most abundant. The tokenized architecture naturally accommodates heterogeneous observing platforms (ships, buoys, tide gauges, and coastal stations) and produces both site-specific predictions and basin-scale gridded products in a single forward pass. These results demonstrate a practical, low-latency post-processing approach that complements NWP by learning to correct systematic forecast errors.</p></details> |  |

Our temporal filtration allows tools developed for filtered static graphs, including persistent homology and recent graph filtration kernels, to be applied directly to temporal graph analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on temporal graph classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning for Paired Immunohistochemistry and Histopathology Slide Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03577v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal, transferable whole-slide image (WSI) representations are central to computational pathology. Incorporating multiple markers (e.g., immunohistochemistry, IHC) alongside H&E enriches H&E-based features with diverse, biologically meaningful information. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of well-aligned multi-stain datasets. Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.

To address the significant gap between textual descriptions and 3D articulated object representations, we propose GAOT, a three-phase framework that generates articulated objects from text prompts, leveraging diffusion models and hypergraph learning in a three-step process. First, we fine-tune a point cloud generation model to produce a coarse representation of objects from text prompts. Given the inherent connection between articulated objects and graph structures, we design a hypergraph-based learning method to refine these coarse representations, representing object parts as graph vertices. Finally, leveraging a diffusion model, the joints of articulated objects-represented as graph edges-are generated based on the object parts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on the PartNet-Mobility dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior performance over previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM Asia2026</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: (i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, (ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, (iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and (iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art methods in linear probing and fine-tuning for LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments on 11 large-scale multi-sensor datasets highlight our superior performance, demonstrating adaptability, efficiency, and robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI)</p></details> |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Augment Plugin for Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03537v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing class-incremental learning (CIL) approaches based on replay or knowledge distillation are often constrained by forgetting or the stability-plasticity dilemma. Some expansion-based approaches could achieve higher accuracy. However, they always require significant parameter increases. In this paper, we propose a plugin extension paradigm termed the Deployment of extra LoRA Components (DLC) for non-pre-trained CIL scenarios.We treat the feature extractor trained through replay or distillation as a base model with rich knowledge. For each task, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to inject task-specific residuals into the base model's deep layers. During inference, representations with task-specific residuals are aggregated to produce classification predictions. To mitigate interference from non-target LoRA plugins, we introduce a lightweight weighting unit. This unit learns to assign importance scores to different LoRA-tuned representations. Like downloadable contents in software, our method serves as a plug-and-play enhancement that efficiently extends the base methods. Remarkably, on the large-scale ImageNet-100, with merely 4 % of the parameters of a standard ResNet-18, our DLC model achieves a significant 8 % improvement in accuracy, demonstrating exceptional efficiency. Moreover, it could surpass state-of-the-art methods under the fixed memory budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches remain heavily English-centric, limiting their effectiveness in multilingual contexts. In this work, we present M3DR (Multilingual Multimodal Document Retrieval), a framework designed to bridge this gap across languages, enabling applicability across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. M3DR leverages synthetic multilingual document data and generalizes across different vision-language architectures and model sizes, enabling robust cross-lingual and cross-modal alignment. Using contrastive training, our models learn unified representations for text and document images that transfer effectively across languages. We validate this capability on 22 typologically diverse languages, demonstrating consistent performance and adaptability across linguistic and script variations. We further introduce a comprehensive benchmark that captures real-world multilingual scenarios, evaluating models under monolingual, multilingual, and mixed-language settings. M3DR generalizes across both single dense vector and ColBERT-style token-level multi-vector retrieval paradigms. Our models, NetraEmbed and ColNetraEmbed achieve state-of-the-art performance with ~150% relative improvements on cross-lingual retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guard Me If You Know Me: Protecting Specific Face-Identity from Deepfakes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19582v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Securing personal identity against deepfake attacks is increasingly critical in the digital age, especially for celebrities and political figures whose faces are easily accessible and frequently targeted. Most existing deepfake detection methods focus on general-purpose scenarios and often ignore the valuable prior knowledge of known facial identities, e.g., "VIP individuals" whose authentic facial data are already available. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VIPGuard}, a unified multimodal framework designed to capture fine-grained and comprehensive facial representations of a given identity, compare them against potentially fake or similar-looking faces, and reason over these comparisons to make accurate and explainable predictions. Specifically, our framework consists of three main stages. First, fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to learn detailed and structural facial attributes. Second, we perform identity-level discriminative learning to enable the model to distinguish subtle differences between highly similar faces, including real and fake variations. Finally, we introduce user-specific customization, where we model the unique characteristics of the target face identity and perform semantic reasoning via MLLM to enable personalized and explainable deepfake detection. Our framework shows clear advantages over previous detection works, where traditional detectors mainly rely on low-level visual cues and provide no human-understandable explanations, while other MLLM-based models often lack a detailed understanding of specific face identities. To facilitate the evaluation of our method, we built a comprehensive identity-aware benchmark called \textbf{VIPBench} for personalized deepfake detection, involving the latest 7 face-swapping and 7 entire face synthesis techniques for generation. The code is available at https://github.com/KQL11/VIPGuard .</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate the negative impacts of reference mismatch in aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, showing that larger reference mismatch hinders effective adaptation given the same amount of data, e.g., as when learning new artistic styles, or personalizing to specific objects. We demonstrate this phenomenon across text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and introduce margin-aware preference optimization (MaPO), a reference-agnostic approach that breaks free from this constraint. By directly optimizing the likelihood margin between preferred and dispreferred outputs under the Bradley-Terry model without anchoring to a reference, MaPO transforms diverse T2I tasks into unified pairwise preference optimization. We validate MaPO's versatility across five challenging domains: (1) safe generation, (2) style adaptation, (3) cultural representation, (4) personalization, and (5) general preference alignment. Our results reveal that MaPO's advantage grows dramatically with reference mismatch severity, outperforming both DPO and specialized methods like DreamBooth while reducing training time by 15%. MaPO thus emerges as a versatile and memory-efficient method for generic T2I adaptation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 Main Technical Track</p></details> |

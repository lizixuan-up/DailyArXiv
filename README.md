| **[Diffusion Models in Recommendation Systems: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10548v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems remain an essential topic due to its wide application in various domains and the business potential behind them. Given the great generation capability exhibited by diffusion models in computer vision recently, many recommender systems have adopted diffusion models and found improvements in performance for various tasks. Research in this domain has been growing rapidly and calling for a systematic survey. In this survey paper, we present and propose a taxonomy in recommender systems that utilize diffusion models. Distinct from a prior survey paper that categorizes based on the role of the diffusion model, we categorize based on the recommendation task at hand. The decision originates from the rationale that after all, the adoption of diffusion models is to enhance the recommendation performance, not vice versa: adapting the recommendation task to enable diffusion models. Nonetheless, we offer a unique perspective for diffusion models in recommender systems complementary to existing surveys. We present the foundational algorithms in diffusion models and their applications in recommender systems to summarize the rapid development in this field. Finally, we discuss open research directions to prepare and encourage further efforts to advance the field. We compile the relevant papers in a public GitHub repository.</p></details> | 38 pages |
| **[Sequential Recommendation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04541v2)** | 2023-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, such as Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), have been successfully applied in sequential recommendation. These methods require sampling from probability distributions and adopt auxiliary loss functions to optimize the model, which can capture the uncertainty of user behaviors and alleviate exposure bias. However, existing generative models still suffer from the posterior collapse problem or the model collapse problem, thus limiting their applications in sequential recommendation. To tackle the challenges mentioned above, we leverage a new paradigm of the generative models, i.e., diffusion models, and present sequential recommendation with diffusion models (DiffRec), which can avoid the issues of VAE- and GAN-based models and show better performance. While diffusion models are originally proposed to process continuous image data, we design an additional transition in the forward process together with a transition in the reverse process to enable the processing of the discrete recommendation data. We also design a different noising strategy that only noises the target item instead of the whole sequence, which is more suitable for sequential recommendation. Based on the modified diffusion process, we derive the objective function of our framework using a simplification technique and design a denoise sequential recommender to fulfill the objective function. As the lengthened diffusion steps substantially increase the time complexity, we propose an efficient training strategy and an efficient inference strategy to reduce training and inference cost and improve recommendation diversity. Extensive experiment results on three public benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach and show that DiffRec outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Diffusion Models for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05033v2)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While traditional recommendation techniques have made significant strides in the past decades, they still suffer from limited generalization performance caused by factors like inadequate collaborative signals, weak latent representations, and noisy data. In response, diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as promising solutions for recommender systems due to their robust generative capabilities, solid theoretical foundations, and improved training stability. To this end, in this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey on diffusion models for recommendation, and draw a bird's-eye view from the perspective of the whole pipeline in real-world recommender systems. We systematically categorize existing research works into three primary domains: (1) diffusion for data engineering & encoding, focusing on data augmentation and representation enhancement; (2) diffusion as recommender models, employing diffusion models to directly estimate user preferences and rank items; and (3) diffusion for content presentation, utilizing diffusion models to generate personalized content such as fashion and advertisement creatives. Our taxonomy highlights the unique strengths of diffusion models in capturing complex data distributions and generating high-quality, diverse samples that closely align with user preferences. We also summarize the core characteristics of the adapting diffusion models for recommendation, and further identify key areas for future exploration, which helps establish a roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to advance recommender systems through the innovative application of diffusion models. To further facilitate the research community of recommender systems based on diffusion models, we actively maintain a GitHub repository for papers and other related resources in this rising direction https://github.com/CHIANGEL/Awesome-Diffusion-for-RecSys.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Asymmetric Diffusion Recommendation Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12706v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, motivated by the outstanding achievements of diffusion models, the diffusion process has been employed to strengthen representation learning in recommendation systems. Most diffusion-based recommendation models typically utilize standard Gaussian noise in symmetric forward and reverse processes in continuous data space. Nevertheless, the samples derived from recommendation systems inhabit a discrete data space, which is fundamentally different from the continuous one. Moreover, Gaussian noise has the potential to corrupt personalized information within latent representations. In this work, we propose a novel and effective method, named Asymmetric Diffusion Recommendation Model (AsymDiffRec), which learns forward and reverse processes in an asymmetric manner. We define a generalized forward process that simulates the missing features in real-world recommendation samples. The reverse process is then performed in an asymmetric latent feature space. To preserve personalized information within the latent representation, a task-oriented optimization strategy is introduced. In the serving stage, the raw sample with missing features is regarded as a noisy input to generate a denoising and robust representation for the final prediction. By equipping base models with AsymDiffRec, we conduct online A/B tests, achieving improvements of +0.131% and +0.166% in terms of users' active days and app usage duration respectively. Additionally, the extended offline experiments also demonstrate improvements. AsymDiffRec has been implemented in the Douyin Music App.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM2025 |
| **[A Diffusion model for POI recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07041v5)** | 2023-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in location-based services that aim to provide personalized suggestions for the user's next destination. Previous works on POI recommendation have laid focused on modeling the user's spatial preference. However, existing works that leverage spatial information are only based on the aggregation of users' previous visited positions, which discourages the model from recommending POIs in novel areas. This trait of position-based methods will harm the model's performance in many situations. Additionally, incorporating sequential information into the user's spatial preference remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose Diff-POI: a Diffusion-based model that samples the user's spatial preference for the next POI recommendation. Inspired by the wide application of diffusion algorithm in sampling from distributions, Diff-POI encodes the user's visiting sequence and spatial character with two tailor-designed graph encoding modules, followed by a diffusion-based sampling strategy to explore the user's spatial visiting trends. We leverage the diffusion process and its reversed form to sample from the posterior distribution and optimized the corresponding score function. We design a joint training and inference framework to optimize and evaluate the proposed Diff-POI. Extensive experiments on four real-world POI recommendation datasets demonstrate the superiority of our Diff-POI over state-of-the-art baseline methods. Further ablation and parameter studies on Diff-POI reveal the functionality and effectiveness of the proposed diffusion-based sampling strategy for addressing the limitations of existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS 2023)</p></details> |
| **[Plug-in Diffusion Model for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02913v1)** | 2024-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pioneering efforts have verified the effectiveness of the diffusion models in exploring the informative uncertainty for recommendation. Considering the difference between recommendation and image synthesis tasks, existing methods have undertaken tailored refinements to the diffusion and reverse process. However, these approaches typically use the highest-score item in corpus for user interest prediction, leading to the ignorance of the user's generalized preference contained within other items, thereby remaining constrained by the data sparsity issue. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel Plug-in Diffusion Model for Recommendation (PDRec) framework, which employs the diffusion model as a flexible plugin to jointly take full advantage of the diffusion-generating user preferences on all items. Specifically, PDRec first infers the users' dynamic preferences on all items via a time-interval diffusion model and proposes a Historical Behavior Reweighting (HBR) mechanism to identify the high-quality behaviors and suppress noisy behaviors. In addition to the observed items, PDRec proposes a Diffusion-based Positive Augmentation (DPA) strategy to leverage the top-ranked unobserved items as the potential positive samples, bringing in informative and diverse soft signals to alleviate data sparsity. To alleviate the false negative sampling issue, PDRec employs Noise-free Negative Sampling (NNS) to select stable negative samples for ensuring effective model optimization. Extensive experiments and analyses on four datasets have verified the superiority of the proposed PDRec over the state-of-the-art baselines and showcased the universality of PDRec as a flexible plugin for commonly-used sequential encoders in different recommendation scenarios. The code is available in https://github.com/hulkima/PDRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[RecDiff: Diffusion Model for Social Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01629v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social recommendation has emerged as a powerful approach to enhance personalized recommendations by leveraging the social connections among users, such as following and friend relations observed in online social platforms. The fundamental assumption of social recommendation is that socially-connected users exhibit homophily in their preference patterns. This means that users connected by social ties tend to have similar tastes in user-item activities, such as rating and purchasing. However, this assumption is not always valid due to the presence of irrelevant and false social ties, which can contaminate user embeddings and adversely affect recommendation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion-based social denoising framework for recommendation (RecDiff). Our approach utilizes a simple yet effective hidden-space diffusion paradigm to alleivate the noisy effect in the compressed and dense representation space. By performing multi-step noise diffusion and removal, RecDiff possesses a robust ability to identify and eliminate noise from the encoded user representations, even when the noise levels vary. The diffusion module is optimized in a downstream task-aware manner, thereby maximizing its ability to enhance the recommendation process. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of our framework, and the results demonstrate its superiority in terms of recommendation accuracy, training efficiency, and denoising effectiveness. The source code for the model implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/RecDiff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperbolic Diffusion Recommender Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01541v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as the new state-of-the-art family of deep generative models. To gain deeper insights into the limitations of diffusion models in recommender systems, we investigate the fundamental structural disparities between images and items. Consequently, items often exhibit distinct anisotropic and directional structures that are less prevalent in images. However, the traditional forward diffusion process continuously adds isotropic Gaussian noise, causing anisotropic signals to degrade into noise, which impairs the semantically meaningful representations in recommender systems. Inspired by the advancements in hyperbolic spaces, we propose a novel \textit{\textbf{H}yperbolic} \textit{\textbf{D}iffusion} \textit{\textbf{R}ecommender} \textit{\textbf{M}odel} (named HDRM). Unlike existing directional diffusion methods based on Euclidean space, the intrinsic non-Euclidean structure of hyperbolic space makes it particularly well-adapted for handling anisotropic diffusion processes. In particular, we begin by formulating concepts to characterize latent directed diffusion processes within a geometrically grounded hyperbolic space. Subsequently, we propose a novel hyperbolic latent diffusion process specifically tailored for users and items. Drawing upon the natural geometric attributes of hyperbolic spaces, we impose structural restrictions on the space to enhance hyperbolic diffusion propagation, thereby ensuring the preservation of the intrinsic topology of user-item graphs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HDRM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-EXR: Controllable Review Generation for Explainable Recommendation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15490v4)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) has shown great competence in image and audio generation tasks. However, there exist few attempts to employ DDPM in the text generation, especially review generation under recommendation systems. Fueled by the predicted reviews explainability that justifies recommendations could assist users better understand the recommended items and increase the transparency of recommendation system, we propose a Diffusion Model-based Review Generation towards EXplainable Recommendation named Diffusion-EXR. Diffusion-EXR corrupts the sequence of review embeddings by incrementally introducing varied levels of Gaussian noise to the sequence of word embeddings and learns to reconstruct the original word representations in the reverse process. The nature of DDPM enables our lightweight Transformer backbone to perform excellently in the recommendation review generation task. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that Diffusion-EXR can achieve state-of-the-art review generation for recommendation on two publicly available benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We request to withdraw our paper from the archive due to significant errors identified in the analysis and conclusions.

| **[Incorporating Classifier-Free Guidance in Diffusion Model-Based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10494v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a diffusion-based recommender system that incorporates classifier-free guidance. Most current recommender systems provide recommendations using conventional methods such as collaborative or content-based filtering. Diffusion is a new approach to generative AI that improves on previous generative AI approaches such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We incorporate diffusion in a recommender system that mirrors the sequence users take when browsing and rating items. Although a few current recommender systems incorporate diffusion, they do not incorporate classifier-free guidance, a new innovation in diffusion models as a whole. In this paper, we present a diffusion recommender system that augments the underlying recommender system model for improved performance and also incorporates classifier-free guidance. Our findings show improvements over state-of-the-art recommender systems for most metrics for several recommendation tasks on a variety of datasets. In particular, our approach demonstrates the potential to provide better recommendations when data is sparse.</p></details> | 8 pages |

| **[Diffusion Recommender Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04971v3)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are widely utilized to model the generative process of user interactions. However, these generative models suffer from intrinsic limitations such as the instability of GANs and the restricted representation ability of VAEs. Such limitations hinder the accurate modeling of the complex user interaction generation procedure, such as noisy interactions caused by various interference factors. In light of the impressive advantages of Diffusion Models (DMs) over traditional generative models in image synthesis, we propose a novel Diffusion Recommender Model (named DiffRec) to learn the generative process in a denoising manner. To retain personalized information in user interactions, DiffRec reduces the added noises and avoids corrupting users' interactions into pure noises like in image synthesis. In addition, we extend traditional DMs to tackle the unique challenges in practical recommender systems: high resource costs for large-scale item prediction and temporal shifts of user preference. To this end, we propose two extensions of DiffRec: L-DiffRec clusters items for dimension compression and conducts the diffusion processes in the latent space; and T-DiffRec reweights user interactions based on the interaction timestamps to encode temporal information. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets under multiple settings (e.g. clean training, noisy training, and temporal training). The empirical results and in-depth analysis validate the superiority of DiffRec with two extensions over competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in SIGIR'23</p></details> |
| **[Denoising Diffusion Recommender Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06982v4)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems often grapple with noisy implicit feedback. Most studies alleviate the noise issues from data cleaning perspective such as data resampling and reweighting, but they are constrained by heuristic assumptions. Another denoising avenue is from model perspective, which proactively injects noises into user-item interactions and enhances the intrinsic denoising ability of models. However, this kind of denoising process poses significant challenges to the recommender model's representation capacity to capture noise patterns. To address this issue, we propose Denoising Diffusion Recommender Model (DDRM), which leverages multi-step denoising process of diffusion models to robustify user and item embeddings from any recommender models. DDRM injects controlled Gaussian noises in the forward process and iteratively removes noises in the reverse denoising process, thereby improving embedding robustness against noisy feedback. To achieve this target, the key lies in offering appropriate guidance to steer the reverse denoising process and providing a proper starting point to start the forward-reverse process during inference. In particular, we propose a dedicated denoising module that encodes collaborative information as denoising guidance. Besides, in the inference stage, DDRM utilizes the average embeddings of users' historically liked items as the starting point rather than using pure noise since pure noise lacks personalization, which increases the difficulty of the denoising process. Extensive experiments on three datasets with three representative backend recommender models demonstrate the effectiveness of DDRM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Dual Conditional Diffusion Models for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21967v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have shown promising results in sequential recommendation (SR). Existing approaches predominantly rely on implicit conditional diffusion models, which compress user behaviors into a single representation during the forward diffusion process. While effective to some extent, this oversimplification often leads to the loss of sequential and contextual information, which is critical for understanding user behavior. Moreover, explicit information, such as user-item interactions or sequential patterns, remains underutilized, despite its potential to directly guide the recommendation process and improve precision. However, combining implicit and explicit information is non-trivial, as it requires dynamically integrating these complementary signals while avoiding noise and irrelevant patterns within user behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose Dual Conditional Diffusion Models for Sequential Recommendation (DCRec), which effectively integrates implicit and explicit information by embedding dual conditions into both the forward and reverse diffusion processes. This allows the model to retain valuable sequential and contextual information while leveraging explicit user-item interactions to guide the recommendation process. Specifically, we introduce the Dual Conditional Diffusion Transformer (DCDT), which employs a cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate explicit signals throughout the diffusion stages, ensuring contextual understanding and minimizing the influence of irrelevant patterns. This design enables precise and contextually relevant recommendations. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DCRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffKG: Knowledge Graph Diffusion Model for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16890v1)** | 2023-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have emerged as invaluable resources for enriching recommendation systems by providing a wealth of factual information and capturing semantic relationships among items. Leveraging KGs can significantly enhance recommendation performance. However, not all relations within a KG are equally relevant or beneficial for the target recommendation task. In fact, certain item-entity connections may introduce noise or lack informative value, thus potentially misleading our understanding of user preferences. To bridge this research gap, we propose a novel knowledge graph diffusion model for recommendation, referred to as DiffKG. Our framework integrates a generative diffusion model with a data augmentation paradigm, enabling robust knowledge graph representation learning. This integration facilitates a better alignment between knowledge-aware item semantics and collaborative relation modeling. Moreover, we introduce a collaborative knowledge graph convolution mechanism that incorporates collaborative signals reflecting user-item interaction patterns, guiding the knowledge graph diffusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, consistently demonstrating the superiority of our DiffKG compared to various competitive baselines. We provide the source code repository of our proposed DiffKG model at the following link: https://github.com/HKUDS/DiffKG.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by WSDM'2024 Oral</p></details> |
| **[DifFaiRec: Generative Fair Recommender with Conditional Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02791v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recommenders can ship items to users automatically based on the users' preferences, they often cause unfairness to groups or individuals. For instance, when users can be divided into two groups according to a sensitive social attribute and there is a significant difference in terms of activity between the two groups, the learned recommendation algorithm will result in a recommendation gap between the two groups, which causes group unfairness. In this work, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm named Diffusion-based Fair Recommender (DifFaiRec) to provide fair recommendations. DifFaiRec is built upon the conditional diffusion model and hence has a strong ability to learn the distribution of user preferences from their ratings on items and is able to generate diverse recommendations effectively. To guarantee fairness, we design a counterfactual module to reduce the model sensitivity to protected attributes and provide mathematical explanations. The experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DifFaiRec over competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by ICDM 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Neural Influence Diffusion Model for Social Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10322v1)** | 2019-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise user and item embedding learning is the key to building a successful recommender system. Traditionally, Collaborative Filtering(CF) provides a way to learn user and item embeddings from the user-item interaction history. However, the performance is limited due to the sparseness of user behavior data. With the emergence of online social networks, social recommender systems have been proposed to utilize each user's local neighbors' preferences to alleviate the data sparsity for better user embedding modeling. We argue that, for each user of a social platform, her potential embedding is influenced by her trusted users. As social influence recursively propagates and diffuses in the social network, each user's interests change in the recursive process. Nevertheless, the current social recommendation models simply developed static models by leveraging the local neighbors of each user without simulating the recursive diffusion in the global social network, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a deep influence propagation model to stimulate how users are influenced by the recursive social diffusion process for social recommendation. For each user, the diffusion process starts with an initial embedding that fuses the related features and a free user latent vector that captures the latent behavior preference. The key idea of our proposed model is that we design a layer-wise influence propagation structure to model how users' latent embeddings evolve as the social diffusion process continues. We further show that our proposed model is general and could be applied when the user~(item) attributes or the social network structure is not available. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model, with more than 13% performance improvements over the best baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1811.02815</p></details> |
| **[How Fair is Your Diffusion Recommender Model?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04339v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based learning has settled as a rising paradigm in generative recommendation, outperforming traditional approaches built upon variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. Despite their effectiveness, concerns have been raised that diffusion models - widely adopted in other machine-learning domains - could potentially lead to unfair outcomes, since they are trained to recover data distributions that often encode inherent biases. Motivated by the related literature, and acknowledging the extensive discussion around bias and fairness aspects in recommendation, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first empirical study of fairness for DiffRec, chronologically the pioneer technique in diffusion-based recommendation. Our empirical study involves DiffRec and its variant L-DiffRec, tested against nine recommender systems on two benchmarking datasets to assess recommendation utility and fairness from both consumer and provider perspectives. Specifically, we first evaluate the utility and fairness dimensions separately and, then, within a multi-criteria setting to investigate whether, and to what extent, these approaches can achieve a trade-off between the two. While showing worrying trends in alignment with the more general machine-learning literature on diffusion models, our results also indicate promising directions to address the unfairness issue in future work.

| **[Collaborative Diffusion Model for Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18997v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based recommender systems (DR) have gained increasing attention for their advanced generative and denoising capabilities. However, existing DR face two central limitations: (i) a trade-off between enhancing generative capacity via noise injection and retaining the loss of personalized information. (ii) the underutilization of rich item-side information. To address these challenges, we present a Collaborative Diffusion model for Recommender System (CDiff4Rec). Specifically, CDiff4Rec generates pseudo-users from item features and leverages collaborative signals from both real and pseudo personalized neighbors identified through behavioral similarity, thereby effectively reconstructing nuanced user preferences. Experimental results on three public datasets show that CDiff4Rec outperforms competitors by effectively mitigating the loss of personalized information through the integration of item content and collaborative signals.</p></details> | WWW'25 short |
| **[LD4MRec: Simplifying and Powering Diffusion Model for Multimedia Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15363v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimedia recommendation aims to predict users' future behaviors based on observed behaviors and item content information. However, the inherent noise contained in observed behaviors easily leads to suboptimal recommendation performance. Recently, the diffusion model's ability to generate information from noise presents a promising solution to this issue, prompting us to explore its application in multimedia recommendation. Nonetheless, several challenges must be addressed: 1) The diffusion model requires simplification to meet the efficiency requirements of real-time recommender systems, 2) The generated behaviors must align with user preference. To address these challenges, we propose a Light Diffusion model for Multimedia Recommendation (LD4MRec). LD4MRec largely reduces computational complexity by employing a forward-free inference strategy, which directly predicts future behaviors from observed noisy behaviors. Meanwhile, to ensure the alignment between generated behaviors and user preference, we propose a novel Conditional neural Network (C-Net). C-Net achieves guided generation by leveraging two key signals, collaborative signals and personalized modality preference signals, thereby improving the semantic consistency between generated behaviors and user preference. Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LD4MRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffMM: Multi-Modal Diffusion Model for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11781v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of online multi-modal sharing platforms like TikTok and YouTube has enabled personalized recommender systems to incorporate multiple modalities (such as visual, textual, and acoustic) into user representations. However, addressing the challenge of data sparsity in these systems remains a key issue. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced self-supervised learning techniques to enhance recommender systems. However, these methods often rely on simplistic random augmentation or intuitive cross-view information, which can introduce irrelevant noise and fail to accurately align the multi-modal context with user-item interaction modeling. To fill this research gap, we propose a novel multi-modal graph diffusion model for recommendation called DiffMM. Our framework integrates a modality-aware graph diffusion model with a cross-modal contrastive learning paradigm to improve modality-aware user representation learning. This integration facilitates better alignment between multi-modal feature information and collaborative relation modeling. Our approach leverages diffusion models' generative capabilities to automatically generate a user-item graph that is aware of different modalities, facilitating the incorporation of useful multi-modal knowledge in modeling user-item interactions. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, consistently demonstrating the superiority of our DiffMM over various competitive baselines.

| **[Diffusion Models for Generative Outfit Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17279v3)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Outfit Recommendation (OR) in the fashion domain has evolved through two stages: Pre-defined Outfit Recommendation and Personalized Outfit Composition. However, both stages are constrained by existing fashion products, limiting their effectiveness in addressing users' diverse fashion needs. Recently, the advent of AI-generated content provides the opportunity for OR to transcend these limitations, showcasing the potential for personalized outfit generation and recommendation. To this end, we introduce a novel task called Generative Outfit Recommendation (GOR), aiming to generate a set of fashion images and compose them into a visually compatible outfit tailored to specific users. The key objectives of GOR lie in the high fidelity, compatibility, and personalization of generated outfits. To achieve these, we propose a generative outfit recommender model named DiFashion, which empowers exceptional diffusion models to accomplish the parallel generation of multiple fashion images. To ensure three objectives, we design three kinds of conditions to guide the parallel generation process and adopt Classifier-Free-Guidance to enhance the alignment between the generated images and conditions. We apply DiFashion on both personalized Fill-In-The-Blank and GOR tasks and conduct extensive experiments on iFashion and Polyvore-U datasets. The quantitative and human-involved qualitative evaluation demonstrate the superiority of DiFashion over competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication in SIGIR'24</p></details> |
| **[Generative Diffusion Models for Sequential Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19429v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown promise in sequential recommendation tasks. However, they face challenges, including posterior collapse and limited representation capacity. The work by Li et al. (2023) introduces a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to address these challenges by representing item embeddings as distributions rather than fixed vectors. This approach allows for a more adaptive reflection of users' diverse interests and various item aspects. During the diffusion phase, the model converts the target item embedding into a Gaussian distribution by adding noise, facilitating the representation of sequential item distributions and the injection of uncertainty. An Approximator then processes this noisy item representation to reconstruct the target item. In the reverse phase, the model utilizes users' past interactions to reverse the noise and finalize the item prediction through a rounding operation. This research introduces enhancements to the DiffuRec architecture, particularly by adding offset noise in the diffusion process to improve robustness and incorporating a cross-attention mechanism in the Approximator to better capture relevant user-item interactions. These contributions led to the development of a new model, DiffuRecSys, which improves performance.

| **[DiffuRec: A Diffusion Model for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.00686v4)** | 2023-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mainstream solutions to Sequential Recommendation (SR) represent items with fixed vectors. These vectors have limited capability in capturing items' latent aspects and users' diverse preferences. As a new generative paradigm, Diffusion models have achieved excellent performance in areas like computer vision and natural language processing. To our understanding, its unique merit in representation generation well fits the problem setting of sequential recommendation. In this paper, we make the very first attempt to adapt Diffusion model to SR and propose DiffuRec, for item representation construction and uncertainty injection. Rather than modeling item representations as fixed vectors, we represent them as distributions in DiffuRec, which reflect user's multiple interests and item's various aspects adaptively. In diffusion phase, DiffuRec corrupts the target item embedding into a Gaussian distribution via noise adding, which is further applied for sequential item distribution representation generation and uncertainty injection. Afterward, the item representation is fed into an Approximator for target item representation reconstruction. In reverse phase, based on user's historical interaction behaviors, we reverse a Gaussian noise into the target item representation, then apply a rounding operation for target item prediction. Experiments over four datasets show that DiffuRec outperforms strong baselines by a large margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging User Dynamics: Transforming Sequential Recommendations with Schrödinger Bridge and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10522v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to accurately capture the dynamic changes in user interests. We have noticed that generative models, especially diffusion models, which have achieved significant results in fields like image and audio, hold considerable promise in the field of sequential recommendation. However, existing sequential recommendation methods based on diffusion models are constrained by a prior distribution limited to Gaussian distribution, hindering the possibility of introducing user-specific information for each recommendation and leading to information loss. To address these issues, we introduce the Schrödinger Bridge into diffusion-based sequential recommendation models, creating the SdifRec model. This allows us to replace the Gaussian prior of the diffusion model with the user's current state, directly modeling the process from a user's current state to the target recommendation. Additionally, to better utilize collaborative information in recommendations, we propose an extended version of SdifRec called con-SdifRec, which utilizes user clustering information as a guiding condition to further enhance the posterior distribution. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of SdifRec and con-SdifRec through comparison with several state-of-the-art methods. Further in-depth analysis has validated their efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | CIKM '24 |
| **[Score-based Generative Diffusion Models for Social Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15579v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prevalence of social networks on online platforms, social recommendation has become a vital technique for enhancing personalized recommendations. The effectiveness of social recommendations largely relies on the social homophily assumption, which presumes that individuals with social connections often share similar preferences. However, this foundational premise has been recently challenged due to the inherent complexity and noise present in real-world social networks. In this paper, we tackle the low social homophily challenge from an innovative generative perspective, directly generating optimal user social representations that maximize consistency with collaborative signals. Specifically, we propose the Score-based Generative Model for Social Recommendation (SGSR), which effectively adapts the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)-based diffusion models for social recommendations. To better fit the recommendation context, SGSR employs a joint curriculum training strategy to mitigate challenges related to missing supervision signals and leverages self-supervised learning techniques to align knowledge across social and collaborative domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in filtering redundant social information and improving recommendation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering</p></details> |

However, earlier reproducibility studies indicate that progress in this area may be quite limited. Specifically, various widespread methodological issues, e.g., comparisons with untuned baseline models, have led to an \emph{illusion of progress}. In this work, our goal is to examine whether these problems persist in today's research. To this end, we aim to reproduce the latest advancements reported from applying modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to recommender systems, focusing on four models published at the top-ranked SIGIR conference in 2023 and 2024. Our findings are concerning, revealing persistent methodological problems. Alarmingly, through experiments, we find that the latest recommendation techniques based on diffusion models, despite their computational complexity and substantial carbon footprint, are consistently outperformed by simpler existing models. Furthermore, we identify key mismatches between the characteristics of diffusion models and those of the traditional \emph{top-n} recommendation task, raising doubts about their suitability for recommendation. We also note that, in the papers we analyze, the generative capabilities of these models are constrained to a minimum. Overall, our results and continued methodological issues call for greater scientific rigor and a disruptive change in the research and publication culture in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffGRM: Diffusion-based Generative Recommendation Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21805v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation (GR) is an emerging paradigm that represents each item via a tokenizer as an n-digit semantic ID (SID) and predicts the next item by autoregressively generating its SID conditioned on the user's history. However, two structural properties of SIDs make ARMs ill-suited. First, intra-item consistency: the n digits jointly specify one item, yet the left-to-right causality trains each digit only under its prefix and blocks bidirectional cross-digit evidence, collapsing supervision to a single causal path. Second, inter-digit heterogeneity: digits differ in semantic granularity and predictability, while the uniform next-token objective assigns equal weight to all digits, overtraining easy digits and undertraining hard digits. To address these two issues, we propose DiffGRM, a diffusion-based GR model that replaces the autoregressive decoder with a masked discrete diffusion model (MDM), thereby enabling bidirectional context and any-order parallel generation of SID digits for recommendation. Specifically, we tailor DiffGRM in three aspects: (1) tokenization with Parallel Semantic Encoding (PSE) to decouple digits and balance per-digit information; (2) training with On-policy Coherent Noising (OCN) that prioritizes uncertain digits via coherent masking to concentrate supervision on high-value signals; and (3) inference with Confidence-guided Parallel Denoising (CPD) that fills higher-confidence digits first and generates diverse Top-K candidates. Experiments show consistent gains over strong generative and discriminative recommendation baselines on multiple datasets, improving NDCG@10 by 6.9%-15.5%.

| **[Unlocking the Power of Diffusion Models in Sequential Recommendation: A Simple and Effective Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19544v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on the often-overlooked issue of embedding collapse in existing diffusion-based sequential recommendation models and propose ADRec, an innovative framework designed to mitigate this problem. Diverging from previous diffusion-based methods, ADRec applies an independent noise process to each token and performs diffusion across the entire target sequence during training. ADRec captures token interdependency through auto-regression while modeling per-token distributions through token-level diffusion. This dual approach enables the model to effectively capture both sequence dynamics and item representations, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. To further mitigate embedding collapse, we propose a three-stage training strategy: (1) pre-training the embedding weights, (2) aligning these weights with the ADRec backbone, and (3) fine-tuning the model. During inference, ADRec applies the denoising process only to the last token, ensuring that the meaningful patterns in historical interactions are preserved. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation across six datasets underscores the effectiveness of ADRec in enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of diffusion-based sequential recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Diffusion Model Reshapes Cold-Start Bundle Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14901v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bundle recommendation aims to recommend a set of items to each user. However, the sparser interactions between users and bundles raise a big challenge, especially in cold-start scenarios. Traditional collaborative filtering methods do not work well for this kind of problem because these models rely on interactions to update the latent embedding, which is hard to work in a cold-start setting. We propose a new approach (DisCo), which relies on a personalized Diffusion backbone, enhanced by disentangled aspects for the user's interest, to generate a bundle in distribution space for each user to tackle the cold-start challenge. During the training phase, DisCo adjusts an additional objective loss term to avoid bias, a prevalent issue while using the generative model for top-$K$ recommendation purposes. Our empirical experiments show that DisCo outperforms five comparative baselines by a large margin on three real-world datasets. Thereby, this study devises a promising framework and essential viewpoints in cold-start recommendation. Our materials for reproducibility are available at: https://github.com/bt-nghia/DisCo.</p></details> |  |
| **[DimeRec: A Unified Framework for Enhanced Sequential Recommendation via Generative Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12153v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential Recommendation (SR) plays a pivotal role in recommender systems by tailoring recommendations to user preferences based on their non-stationary historical interactions. Achieving high-quality performance in SR requires attention to both item representation and diversity. However, designing an SR method that simultaneously optimizes these merits remains a long-standing challenge. In this study, we address this issue by integrating recent generative Diffusion Models (DM) into SR. DM has demonstrated utility in representation learning and diverse image generation. Nevertheless, a straightforward combination of SR and DM leads to sub-optimal performance due to discrepancies in learning objectives (recommendation vs. noise reconstruction) and the respective learning spaces (non-stationary vs. stationary). To overcome this, we propose a novel framework called DimeRec (\textbf{Di}ffusion with \textbf{m}ulti-interest \textbf{e}nhanced \textbf{Rec}ommender). DimeRec synergistically combines a guidance extraction module (GEM) and a generative diffusion aggregation module (DAM). The GEM extracts crucial stationary guidance signals from the user's non-stationary interaction history, while the DAM employs a generative diffusion process conditioned on GEM's outputs to reconstruct and generate consistent recommendations. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that DimeRec significantly outperforms established baseline methods across three publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we have successfully deployed DimeRec on a large-scale short video recommendation platform, serving hundreds of millions of users. Live A/B testing confirms that our method improves both users' time spent and result diversification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Model for Interest Refinement in Multi-Interest Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05561v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-interest candidate matching plays a pivotal role in personalized recommender systems, as it captures diverse user interests from their historical behaviors. Most existing methods utilize attention mechanisms to generate interest representations by aggregating historical item embeddings. However, these methods only capture overall item-level relevance, leading to coarse-grained interest representations that include irrelevant information. To address this issue, we propose the Diffusion Multi-Interest model (DMI), a novel framework for refining user interest representations at the dimension level. Specifically, DMI first introduces controllable noise into coarse-grained interest representations at the dimensional level. Then, in the iterative reconstruction process, DMI combines a cross-attention mechanism and an item pruning strategy to reconstruct the personalized interest vectors with the guidance of tailored collaborative information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DMI, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test. Successfully deployed in the real-world recommender system, DMI effectively enhances user satisfaction and system performance at scale, serving the major traffic of hundreds of millions of daily active users. \footnote{The code will be released for reproducibility once the paper is accepted.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Preference-Guided Diffusion Model for Cross-Domain Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11671v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been proven as a promising way to alleviate the cold-start issue, in which the most critical problem is how to draw an informative user representation in the target domain via the transfer of user preference existing in the source domain. Prior efforts mostly follow the embedding-and-mapping paradigm, which first integrate the preference into user representation in the source domain, and then perform a mapping function on this representation to the target domain. However, they focus on mapping features across domains, neglecting to explicitly model the preference integration process, which may lead to learning coarse user representation. Diffusion models (DMs), which contribute to more accurate user/item representations due to their explicit information injection capability, have achieved promising performance in recommendation systems. Nevertheless, these DMs-based methods cannot directly account for valuable user preference in other domains, leading to challenges in adapting to the transfer of preference for cold-start users. Consequently, the feasibility of DMs for CDR remains underexplored. To this end, we explore to utilize the explicit information injection capability of DMs for user preference integration and propose a Preference-Guided Diffusion Model for CDR to cold-start users, termed as DMCDR. Specifically, we leverage a preference encoder to establish the preference guidance signal with the user's interaction history in the source domain. Then, we explicitly inject the preference guidance signal into the user representation step by step to guide the reverse process, and ultimately generate the personalized user representation in the target domain, thus achieving the transfer of user preference across domains. Furthermore, we comprehensively explore the impact of six DMs-based variants on CDR.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by KDD'2025</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Item-Level Dynamic Variability with Residual Diffusion for Bundle Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03280v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing solutions for bundle recommendation(BR) have achieved remarkable effectiveness for predicting the user's preference for prebuilt bundles. However, bundle-item(B-I) affiliation will vary dynamically in real scenarios. For example, a bundle themed as 'casual outfit', may add 'hat' or remove 'watch' due to factors such as seasonal variations, changes in user pes or inventory adjustments. Our empirical study demonstrates that the performance of mainstream BR models will fluctuate or even decline regarding item-level variability. This paper makes the first attempt to referencaddress the above problem and proposes a novel Residual Diffusion for Bundle Recommendation(RDiffBR) as a model-agnostic generative framework which can assist a BR model in adapting this scenario. During the initial training of the BR model, RDiffBR employs a residual diffusion model to process the item-level bundle embeddings which are generated by BR model to represent bundle theme via a forward-reverse process. In the inference stage, RDiffBR reverses item-level bundle embeddings obtained by the well-trained bundle model under B-I variability scenarios to generate the effective item-level bundle embeddings. In particular, the residual connection in our residual approximator significantly enhances item-level bundle embeddings generation ability of BR models. Experiments on six BR models and four public datasets from different domains show that RDiffBR improves the performance of Recall and NDCG of backbone BR models by up to 23%, while only increased training time about 4%.Codes and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RDiffBR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion Model for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07243v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heuristic negative sampling enhances recommendation performance by selecting negative samples of varying hardness levels from predefined candidate pools to guide the model toward learning more accurate decision boundaries. However, our empirical and theoretical analyses reveal that unobserved environmental confounders (e.g., exposure or popularity biases) in candidate pools may cause heuristic sampling methods to introduce false hard negatives (FHNS). These misleading samples can encourage the model to learn spurious correlations induced by such confounders, ultimately compromising its generalization ability under distribution shifts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion (CNSDiff). By synthesizing negative samples in the latent space via a conditional diffusion process, CNSDiff avoids the bias introduced by predefined candidate pools and thus reduces the likelihood of generating FHNS. Moreover, it incorporates a causal regularization term to explicitly mitigate the influence of environmental confounders during the negative sampling process, leading to robust negatives that promote out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Comprehensive experiments under four representative distribution shift scenarios demonstrate that CNSDiff achieves an average improvement of 13.96% across all evaluation metrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines, verifying its effectiveness and robustness in OOD recommendation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, Under-review</p></details> |
| **[Distributionally Robust Graph Out-of-Distribution Recommendation via Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15555v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based graph neural network methods improve recommendation systems' out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization by optimizing the model's worst-case performance. However, these studies fail to consider the impact of noisy samples in the training data, which results in diminished generalization capabilities and lower accuracy. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, this paper reveals that current DRO-based graph recommendation methods assign greater weight to noise distribution, leading to model parameter learning being dominated by it. When the model overly focuses on fitting noise samples in the training data, it may learn irrelevant or meaningless features that cannot be generalized to OOD data. To address this challenge, we design a Distributionally Robust Graph model for OOD recommendation (DRGO). Specifically, our method first employs a simple and effective diffusion paradigm to alleviate the noisy effect in the latent space. Additionally, an entropy regularization term is introduced in the DRO objective function to avoid extreme sample weights in the worst-case distribution. Finally, we provide a theoretical proof of the generalization error bound of DRGO as well as a theoretical analysis of how our approach mitigates noisy sample effects, which helps to better understand the proposed framework from a theoretical perspective. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework against three typical distribution shifts, and the results demonstrate its superiority in both independently and identically distributed distributions (IID) and OOD.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, Accepted by WWW'25</p></details> |
| **[A Hierarchical Structure-Enhanced Personalized Recommendation Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulas Based on KG Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23560v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i) Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI, and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm for the recommendation of modern TCM.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, Proceedings of the 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)</p></details> |

We revisit SR from a novel information-theoretic perspective and find that conventional sequential modeling methods fail to adequately capture the randomness and unpredictability of user behavior. Inspired by fuzzy information processing theory, this paper introduces the DDSR model, which uses fuzzy sets of interaction sequences to overcome the limitations and better capture the evolution of users' real interests. Formally based on diffusion transition processes in discrete state spaces, which is unlike common diffusion models such as DDPM that operate in continuous domains. It is better suited for discrete data, using structured transitions instead of arbitrary noise introduction to avoid information loss. Additionally, to address the inefficiency of matrix transformations due to the vast discrete space, we use semantic labels derived from quantization or RQ-VAE to replace item IDs, enhancing efficiency and improving cold start issues. Testing on three public benchmark datasets shows that DDSR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in various settings, demonstrating its potential and effectiveness in handling SR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS'2024, 10 pages</p></details> |

Unlike image data which contain spatial correlations, a user-item interaction matrix, commonly utilized in recommendation, lacks spatial relationships between users and items. We formulate diffusion on a 1D vector and propose binomial diffusion, which explicitly models binary user-item interactions with a Bernoulli process. We show that RecFusion approaches the performance of complex VAE baselines on the core recommendation setting (top-n recommendation for binary non-sequential feedback) and the most common datasets (MovieLens and Netflix). Our proposed diffusion models that are specialized for 1D and/or binary setups have implications beyond recommendation systems, such as in the medical domain with MRI and CT scans.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/gabriben/recfusion</p></details> |
| **[Discrete Conditional Diffusion for Reranking in Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06982v1)** | 2023-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reranking plays a crucial role in modern multi-stage recommender systems by rearranging the initial ranking list to model interplay between items. Considering the inherent challenges of reranking such as combinatorial searching space, some previous studies have adopted the evaluator-generator paradigm, with a generator producing feasible sequences and a evaluator selecting the best one based on estimated listwise utility. Inspired by the remarkable success of diffusion generative models, this paper explores the potential of diffusion models for generating high-quality sequences in reranking. However, we argue that it is nontrivial to take diffusion models as the generator in the context of recommendation. Firstly, diffusion models primarily operate in continuous data space, differing from the discrete data space of item permutations. Secondly, the recommendation task is different from conventional generation tasks as the purpose of recommender systems is to fulfill user interests. Lastly, real-life recommender systems require efficiency, posing challenges for the inference of diffusion models. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Discrete Conditional Diffusion Reranking (DCDR) framework for recommendation. DCDR extends traditional diffusion models by introducing a discrete forward process with tractable posteriors, which adds noise to item sequences through step-wise discrete operations (e.g., swapping). Additionally, DCDR incorporates a conditional reverse process that generates item sequences conditioned on expected user responses. Extensive offline experiments conducted on public datasets demonstrate that DCDR outperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods. Furthermore, DCDR has been deployed in a real-world video app with over 300 million daily active users, significantly enhancing online recommendation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Augmentation for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12858v1)** | 2023-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation (SRS) has become the technical foundation in many applications recently, which aims to recommend the next item based on the user's historical interactions. However, sequential recommendation often faces the problem of data sparsity, which widely exists in recommender systems. Besides, most users only interact with a few items, but existing SRS models often underperform these users. Such a problem, named the long-tail user problem, is still to be resolved. Data augmentation is a distinct way to alleviate these two problems, but they often need fabricated training strategies or are hindered by poor-quality generated interactions. To address these problems, we propose a Diffusion Augmentation for Sequential Recommendation (DiffuASR) for a higher quality generation. The augmented dataset by DiffuASR can be used to train the sequential recommendation models directly, free from complex training procedures. To make the best of the generation ability of the diffusion model, we first propose a diffusion-based pseudo sequence generation framework to fill the gap between image and sequence generation. Then, a sequential U-Net is designed to adapt the diffusion noise prediction model U-Net to the discrete sequence generation task. At last, we develop two guide strategies to assimilate the preference between generated and origin sequences. To validate the proposed DiffuASR, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets with three sequential recommendation models. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of DiffuASR. As far as we know, DiffuASR is one pioneer that introduce the diffusion model to the recommendation.</p></details> |  |

Integration of CL with graph convolutional network (GCN)-based collaborative filterings (CFs) has been explored in recommender systems. However, current CL-based recommendation models heavily rely on low-pass filters and graph augmentations. In this paper, inspired by the reaction-diffusion equation, we propose a novel CL method for recommender systems called the reaction-diffusion graph contrastive learning model (RDGCL). We design our own GCN for CF based on the equations of diffusion, i.e., low-pass filter, and reaction, i.e., high-pass filter. Our proposed CL-based training occurs between reaction and diffusion-based embeddings, so there is no need for graph augmentations. Experimental evaluation on 5 benchmark datasets demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art CL-based recommendation models. By enhancing recommendation accuracy and diversity, our method brings an advancement in CL for recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Jeong...</summary><p>Jeongwhan Choi and Hyowon Wi are co-first authors with equal contributions</p></details> |
| **[Fading to Grow: Growing Preference Ratios via Preference Fading Discrete Diffusion for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26063v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommenders aim to rank items from a discrete item corpus in line with user interests, yet suffer from extremely sparse user preference data. Recent advances in diffusion models have inspired diffusion-based recommenders, which alleviate sparsity by injecting noise during a forward process to prevent the collapse of perturbed preference distributions. However, current diffusion-based recommenders predominantly rely on continuous Gaussian noise, which is intrinsically mismatched with the discrete nature of user preference data in recommendation. In this paper, building upon recent advances in discrete diffusion, we propose PreferGrow, a discrete diffusion-based recommender system that models preference ratios by fading and growing user preferences over the discrete item corpus. PreferGrow differs from existing diffusion-based recommenders in three core aspects: (1) Discrete modeling of preference ratios: PreferGrow models relative preference ratios between item pairs, rather than operating in the item representation or raw score simplex. This formulation aligns naturally with the discrete and ranking-oriented nature of recommendation tasks. (2) Perturbing via preference fading: Instead of injecting continuous noise, PreferGrow fades user preferences by replacing the preferred item with alternatives -- physically akin to negative sampling -- thereby eliminating the need for any prior noise assumption. (3) Preference reconstruction via growing: PreferGrow reconstructs user preferences by iteratively growing the preference signals from the estimated ratios. PreferGrow offers a well-defined matrix-based formulation with theoretical guarantees on Markovianity and reversibility, and it demonstrates consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art diffusion-based recommenders across five benchmark datasets, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and empirical effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Tuning Diffusion-Based Recommender Systems via Reinforcement Learning with Reward Function Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06937v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for recommender systems, offering state-of-the-art performance by modeling the generative process of user-item interactions. However, training such models from scratch is both computationally expensive and yields diminishing returns once convergence is reached. To remedy these challenges, we propose ReFiT, a new framework that integrates Reinforcement learning (RL)-based Fine-Tuning into diffusion-based recommender systems. In contrast to prior RL approaches for diffusion models depending on external reward models, ReFiT adopts a task-aligned design: it formulates the denoising trajectory as a Markov decision process (MDP) and incorporates a collaborative signal-aware reward function that directly reflects recommendation quality. By tightly coupling the MDP structure with this reward signal, ReFiT empowers the RL agent to exploit high-order connectivity for fine-grained optimization, while avoiding the noisy or uninformative feedback common in naive reward designs. Leveraging policy gradient optimization, ReFiT maximizes exact log-likelihood of observed interactions, thereby enabling effective post hoc fine-tuning of diffusion recommenders. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ReFiT framework (a) exhibits substantial performance gains over strong competitors (up to 36.3% on sequential recommendation), (b) demonstrates strong efficiency with linear complexity in the number of users or items, and (c) generalizes well across multiple diffusion-based recommendation scenarios. The source code and datasets are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReFiT-4C60.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Unconditional Diffusion for Generative Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06121v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, known for their generative ability to simulate data creation through noise-adding and denoising processes, have emerged as a promising approach for building generative recommenders. To incorporate user history for personalization, existing methods typically adopt a conditional diffusion framework, where the reverse denoising process of reconstructing items from noise is modified to be conditioned on the user history. However, this design may fail to fully utilize historical information, as it gets distracted by the need to model the "item $\leftrightarrow$ noise" translation. This motivates us to reformulate the diffusion process for sequential recommendation in an unconditional manner, treating user history (instead of noise) as the endpoint of the forward diffusion process (i.e., the starting point of the reverse process), rather than as a conditional input. This formulation allows for exclusive focus on modeling the "item $\leftrightarrow$ history" translation. To this end, we introduce Brownian Bridge Diffusion Recommendation (BBDRec). By leveraging a Brownian bridge process, BBDRec enforces a structured noise addition and denoising mechanism, ensuring that the trajectories are constrained towards a specific endpoint -- user history, rather than noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate BBDRec's effectiveness in enhancing sequential recommendation performance. The source code is available at https://github.com/baiyimeng/BBDRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[IGNiteR: News Recommendation in Microblogging Applications (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01942v1)** | 2022-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>News recommendation is one of the most challenging tasks in recommender systems, mainly due to the ephemeral relevance of news to users. As social media, and particularly microblogging applications like Twitter or Weibo, gains popularity as platforms for news dissemination, personalized news recommendation in this context becomes a significant challenge. We revisit news recommendation in the microblogging scenario, by taking into consideration social interactions and observations tracing how the information that is up for recommendation spreads in an underlying network. We propose a deep-learning based approach that is diffusion and influence-aware, called Influence-Graph News Recommender (IGNiteR). It is a content-based deep recommendation model that jointly exploits all the data facets that may impact adoption decisions, namely semantics, diffusion-related features pertaining to local and global influence among users, temporal attractiveness, and timeliness, as well as dynamic user preferences. To represent the news, a multi-level attention-based encoder is used to reveal the different interests of users. This news encoder relies on a CNN for the news content and on an attentive LSTM for the diffusion traces. For the latter, by exploiting previously observed news diffusions (cascades) in the microblogging medium, users are mapped to a latent space that captures potential influence on others or susceptibility of being influenced for news adoptions. Similarly, a time-sensitive user encoder enables us to capture the dynamic preferences of users with an attention-based bidirectional LSTM. We perform extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, showing that IGNiteR outperforms the state-of-the-art deep-learning based news recommendation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>News ...</summary><p>News recommendation, deep learning, diffusion</p></details> |
| **[A Directional Diffusion Graph Transformer for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03326v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world recommender systems, implicitly collected user feedback, while abundant, often includes noisy false-positive and false-negative interactions. The possible misinterpretations of the user-item interactions pose a significant challenge for traditional graph neural recommenders. These approaches aggregate the users' or items' neighbours based on implicit user-item interactions in order to accurately capture the users' profiles. To account for and model possible noise in the users' interactions in graph neural recommenders, we propose a novel Diffusion Graph Transformer (DiffGT) model for top-k recommendation. Our DiffGT model employs a diffusion process, which includes a forward phase for gradually introducing noise to implicit interactions, followed by a reverse process to iteratively refine the representations of the users' hidden preferences (i.e., a denoising process). In our proposed approach, given the inherent anisotropic structure observed in the user-item interaction graph, we specifically use anisotropic and directional Gaussian noises in the forward diffusion process. Our approach differs from the sole use of isotropic Gaussian noises in existing diffusion models. In the reverse diffusion process, to reverse the effect of noise added earlier and recover the true users' preferences, we integrate a graph transformer architecture with a linear attention module to denoise the noisy user/item embeddings in an effective and efficient manner. In addition, such a reverse diffusion process is further guided by personalised information (e.g., interacted items) to enable the accurate estimation of the users' preferences on items. Our extensive experiments conclusively demonstrate the superiority of our proposed graph diffusion model over ten existing state-of-the-art approaches across three benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[SocialGCN: An Efficient Graph Convolutional Network based Model for Social Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.02815v2)** | 2019-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most successful approaches for recommender systems. With the emergence of online social networks, social recommendation has become a popular research direction. Most of these social recommendation models utilized each user's local neighbors' preferences to alleviate the data sparsity issue in CF. However, they only considered the local neighbors of each user and neglected the process that users' preferences are influenced as information diffuses in the social network. Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks~(GCN) have shown promising results by modeling the information diffusion process in graphs that leverage both graph structure and node feature information. To this end, in this paper, we propose an effective graph convolutional neural network based model for social recommendation. Based on a classical CF model, the key idea of our proposed model is that we borrow the strengths of GCNs to capture how users' preferences are influenced by the social diffusion process in social networks. The diffusion of users' preferences is built on a layer-wise diffusion manner, with the initial user embedding as a function of the current user's features and a free base user latent vector that is not contained in the user feature. Similarly, each item's latent vector is also a combination of the item's free latent vector, as well as its feature representation. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model is flexible when user and item features are not available. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our n...</summary><p>Our new version of this paper has been accepted by SIGIR 2019 and the link to the new version is arXiv:1904.10322</p></details> |
| **[Flow Matching based Sequential Recommender Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16298v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, particularly diffusion model, have emerged as powerful tools for sequential recommendation. However, accurately modeling user preferences remains challenging due to the noise perturbations inherent in the forward and reverse processes of diffusion-based methods. Towards this end, this study introduces FMRec, a Flow Matching based model that employs a straight flow trajectory and a modified loss tailored for the recommendation task. Additionally, from the diffusion-model perspective, we integrate a reconstruction loss to improve robustness against noise perturbations, thereby retaining user preferences during the forward process. In the reverse process, we employ a deterministic reverse sampler, specifically an ODE-based updating function, to eliminate unnecessary randomness, thereby ensuring that the generated recommendations closely align with user needs. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets reveal that FMRec achieves an average improvement of 6.53% over state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Divide-and-Conquer: Cold-Start Bundle Recommendation via Mixture of Diffusion Experts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05035v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cold-start bundle recommendation focuses on modeling new bundles with insufficient information to provide recommendations. Advanced bundle recommendation models usually learn bundle representations from multiple views (e.g., interaction view) at both the bundle and item levels. Consequently, the cold-start problem for bundles is more challenging than that for traditional items due to the dual-level multi-view complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel Mixture of Diffusion Experts (MoDiffE) framework, which employs a divide-and-conquer strategy for cold-start bundle recommendation and follows three steps:(1) Divide: The bundle cold-start problem is divided into independent but similar sub-problems sequentially by level and view, which can be summarized as the poor representation of feature-missing bundles in prior-embedding models. (2) Conquer: Beyond prior-embedding models that fundamentally provide the embedded representations, we introduce a diffusion-based method to solve all sub-problems in a unified way, which directly generates diffusion representations using diffusion models without depending on specific features. (3) Combine: A cold-aware hierarchical Mixture of Experts (MoE) is employed to combine results of the sub-problems for final recommendations, where the two models for each view serve as experts and are adaptively fused for different bundles in a multi-layer manner. Additionally, MoDiffE adopts a multi-stage decoupled training pipeline and introduces a cold-start gating augmentation method to enable the training of gating for cold bundles. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that MoDiffE significantly outperforms existing solutions in handling cold-start bundle recommendation. It achieves up to a 0.1027 absolute gain in Recall@20 in cold-start scenarios and up to a 47.43\% relative improvement in all-bundle scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-driven SpatioTemporal Graph KANsformer for Medical Examination Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07431v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems in AI-based medical diagnostics and treatment constitute a critical component of AI in healthcare. Although some studies have explored this area and made notable progress, healthcare recommendation systems remain in their nascent stage. And these researches mainly target the treatment process such as drug or disease recommendations. In addition to the treatment process, the diagnostic process, particularly determining which medical examinations are necessary to evaluate the condition, also urgently requires intelligent decision support. To bridge this gap, we first formalize the task of medical examination recommendations. Compared to traditional recommendations, the medical examination recommendation involves more complex interactions. This complexity arises from two folds: 1) The historical medical records for examination recommendations are heterogeneous and redundant, which makes the recommendation results susceptible to noise. 2) The correlation between the medical history of patients is often irregular, making it challenging to model spatiotemporal dependencies. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel Diffusion-driven SpatioTemporal Graph KANsformer for Medical Examination Recommendation (DST-GKAN) with a two-stage learning paradigm to solve the above challenges. In the first stage, we exploit a task-adaptive diffusion model to distill recommendation-oriented information by reducing the noises in heterogeneous medical data. In the second stage, a spatiotemporal graph KANsformer is proposed to simultaneously model the complex spatial and temporal relationships. Moreover, to facilitate the medical examination recommendation research, we introduce a comprehensive dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method compared to various competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recommending links through influence maximization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04368v1)** | 2017-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The link recommendation problem consists in suggesting a set of links to the users of a social network in order to increase their social circles and the connectivity of the network. Link recommendation is extensively studied in the context of social networks and of general complex networks due to its wide range of applications. Most of the existing link recommendation methods estimate the likelihood that a link is adopted by users and recommend links that are likely to be established. However, most of such methods overlook the impact that the suggested links have on the capability of the network to spread information. Indeed, such capability is directly correlated with both the engagement of a single user and the revenue of online social networks. In this paper, we study link recommendation systems from the point of view of information diffusion. In detail, we consider the problem in which we are allowed to spend a given budget to create new links so to suggest a bounded number of possible persons to whom become friend in order to maximize the influence of a given set of nodes. We model the influence diffusion in a network with the popular Independent Cascade model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing Cold-start Problem in Click-Through Rate Prediction via Supervised Diffusion Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06270v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting Click-Through Rates is a crucial function within recommendation and advertising platforms, as the output of CTR prediction determines the order of items shown to users. The Embedding \& MLP paradigm has become a standard approach for industrial recommendation systems and has been widely deployed. However, this paradigm suffers from cold-start problems, where there is either no or only limited user action data available, leading to poorly learned ID embeddings. The cold-start problem hampers the performance of new items. To address this problem, we designed a novel diffusion model to generate a warmed-up embedding for new items. Specifically, we define a novel diffusion process between the ID embedding space and the side information space. In addition, we can derive a sub-sequence from the diffusion steps to expedite training, given that our diffusion model is non-Markovian. Our diffusion model is supervised by both the variational inference and binary cross-entropy objectives, enabling it to generate warmed-up embeddings for items in both the cold-start and warm-up phases. Additionally, we have conducted extensive experiments on three recommendation datasets. The results confirmed the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Generative Recommendation with Continuous Tokens](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12007v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems (RecSys). Most existing LLM-based RecSys approaches operate in a discrete space, using vector-quantized tokenizers to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, these quantization methods often result in lossy tokenization and suboptimal learning, primarily due to inaccurate gradient propagation caused by the non-differentiable argmin operation in standard vector quantization. Inspired by the emerging trend of embracing continuous tokens in language models, we propose ContRec, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates continuous tokens into LLM-based RecSys. Specifically, ContRec consists of two key modules: a sigma-VAE Tokenizer, which encodes users/items with continuous tokens; and a Dispersive Diffusion module, which captures implicit user preference. The tokenizer is trained with a continuous Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) objective, where three effective techniques are adopted to avoid representation collapse. By conditioning on the previously generated tokens of the LLM backbone during user modeling, the Dispersive Diffusion module performs a conditional diffusion process with a novel Dispersive Loss, enabling high-quality user preference generation through next-token diffusion. Finally, ContRec leverages both the textual reasoning output from the LLM and the latent representations produced by the diffusion model for Top-K item retrieval, thereby delivering comprehensive recommendation results. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that ContRec consistently outperforms both traditional and SOTA LLM-based recommender systems. Our results highlight the potential of continuous tokenization and generative modeling for advancing the next generation of recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffNet++: A Neural Influence and Interest Diffusion Network for Social Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.00844v4)** | 2021-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social recommendation has emerged to leverage social connections among users for predicting users' unknown preferences, which could alleviate the data sparsity issue in collaborative filtering based recommendation. Early approaches relied on utilizing each user's first-order social neighbors' interests for better user modeling and failed to model the social influence diffusion process from the global social network structure. Recently, we propose a preliminary work of a neural influence diffusion network (i.e., DiffNet) for social recommendation (Diffnet), which models the recursive social diffusion process to capture the higher-order relationships for each user. However, we argue that, as users play a central role in both user-user social network and user-item interest network, only modeling the influence diffusion process in the social network would neglect the users' latent collaborative interests in the user-item interest network. In this paper, we propose DiffNet++, an improved algorithm of DiffNet that models the neural influence diffusion and interest diffusion in a unified framework. By reformulating the social recommendation as a heterogeneous graph with social network and interest network as input, DiffNet++ advances DiffNet by injecting these two network information for user embedding learning at the same time. This is achieved by iteratively aggregating each user's embedding from three aspects: the user's previous embedding, the influence aggregation of social neighbors from the social network, and the interest aggregation of item neighbors from the user-item interest network. Furthermore, we design a multi-level attention network that learns how to attentively aggregate user embeddings from these three aspects. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

However, there is still no convincing model that can accurately depict a video's popularity evolution. In this paper, we propose a dynamic popularity model by modeling the video information diffusion process driven by various forms of recommendation. Through fitting the model with real traces collected from a practical system, we can quantify the strengths of the recommendation forces. Such quantification can lead to characterizing video popularity patterns, user behaviors and recommendation strategies, which is illustrated by a case study of TV episodes.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[LLaDA-Rec: Discrete Diffusion for Parallel Semantic ID Generation in Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06254v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation represents each item as a semantic ID, i.e., a sequence of discrete tokens, and generates the next item through autoregressive decoding. While effective, existing autoregressive models face two intrinsic limitations: (1) unidirectional constraints, where causal attention restricts each token to attend only to its predecessors, hindering global semantic modeling; and (2) error accumulation, where the fixed left-to-right generation order causes prediction errors in early tokens to propagate to the predictions of subsequent token. To address these issues, we propose LLaDA-Rec, a discrete diffusion framework that reformulates recommendation as parallel semantic ID generation. By combining bidirectional attention with the adaptive generation order, the approach models inter-item and intra-item dependencies more effectively and alleviates error accumulation. Specifically, our approach comprises three key designs: (1) a parallel tokenization scheme that produces semantic IDs for bidirectional modeling, addressing the mismatch between residual quantization and bidirectional architectures; (2) two masking mechanisms at the user-history and next-item levels to capture both inter-item sequential dependencies and intra-item semantic relationships; and (3) an adapted beam search strategy for adaptive-order discrete diffusion decoding, resolving the incompatibility of standard beam search with diffusion-based generation. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that LLaDA-Rec consistently outperforms both ID-based and state-of-the-art generative recommenders, establishing discrete diffusion as a new paradigm for generative recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Item Promotion on Visually-Aware Recommender Systems by Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15826v4)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visually-aware recommender systems have found widespread application in domains where visual elements significantly contribute to the inference of users' potential preferences. While the incorporation of visual information holds the promise of enhancing recommendation accuracy and alleviating the cold-start problem, it is essential to point out that the inclusion of item images may introduce substantial security challenges. Some existing works have shown that the item provider can manipulate item exposure rates to its advantage by constructing adversarial images. However, these works cannot reveal the real vulnerability of visually-aware recommender systems because (1) The generated adversarial images are markedly distorted, rendering them easily detectable by human observers; (2) The effectiveness of the attacks is inconsistent and even ineffective in some scenarios. To shed light on the real vulnerabilities of visually-aware recommender systems when confronted with adversarial images, this paper introduces a novel attack method, IPDGI (Item Promotion by Diffusion Generated Image). Specifically, IPDGI employs a guided diffusion model to generate adversarial samples designed to deceive visually-aware recommender systems. Taking advantage of accurately modeling benign images' distribution by diffusion models, the generated adversarial images have high fidelity with original images, ensuring the stealth of our IPDGI. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments on two commonly used e-commerce recommendation datasets (Amazon Beauty and Amazon Baby) with several typical visually-aware recommender systems. The experimental results show that our attack method has a significant improvement in both the performance of promoting the long-tailed (i.e., unpopular) items and the quality of generated adversarial images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TOIS 2024</p></details> |

Although knowledge-free models are able to bolster recommendations by direct edge operations as well, the absence of augmentation primitives drives them to fall short in bridging semantic and structural gaps as high-quality paradigm substitutes. Unlike existing diffusion-based works that remodel user-item interactions, this work proposes NodeDiffRec, a pioneering knowledge-free augmentation framework that enables fine-grained node-level graph generation for recommendations and expands the scope of restricted augmentation primitives via diffusion. By synthesizing pseudo-items and corresponding interactions that align with the underlying distribution for injection, and further refining user preferences through a denoising preference modeling process, NodeDiffRec dramatically enhances both semantic diversity and structural connectivity without external knowledge. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and recommendation algorithms demonstrate the superiority of NodeDiffRec, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance, with maximum average performance improvement 98.6% in Recall@5 and 84.0% in NDCG@5 over selected baselines.</p></details> |  |

At their core, recommender systems address a fundamental problem: matching users with items. Over the past decades, the field has experienced successive paradigm shifts, from collaborative filtering and matrix factorization in the machine learning era to neural architectures in the deep learning era. Recently, the emergence of generative models, especially large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, have sparked a new paradigm: generative recommendation, which reconceptualizes recommendation as a generation task rather than discriminative scoring. This survey provides a comprehensive examination through a unified tripartite framework spanning data, model, and task dimensions. Rather than simply categorizing works, we systematically decompose approaches into operational stages-data augmentation and unification, model alignment and training, task formulation and execution. At the data level, generative models enable knowledge-infused augmentation and agent-based simulation while unifying heterogeneous signals. At the model level, we taxonomize LLM-based methods, large recommendation models, and diffusion approaches, analyzing their alignment mechanisms and innovations. At the task level, we illuminate new capabilities including conversational interaction, explainable reasoning, and personalized content generation. We identify five key advantages: world knowledge integration, natural language understanding, reasoning capabilities, scaling laws, and creative generation. We critically examine challenges in benchmark design, model robustness, and deployment efficiency, while charting a roadmap toward intelligent recommendation assistants that fundamentally reshape human-information interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Filtering Based on Diffusion Models: Unveiling the Potential of High-Order Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14240v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent study has shown that diffusion models are well-suited for modeling the generative process of user-item interactions in recommender systems due to their denoising nature. However, existing diffusion model-based recommender systems do not explicitly leverage high-order connectivities that contain crucial collaborative signals for accurate recommendations. Addressing this gap, we propose CF-Diff, a new diffusion model-based collaborative filtering (CF) method, which is capable of making full use of collaborative signals along with multi-hop neighbors. Specifically, the forward-diffusion process adds random noise to user-item interactions, while the reverse-denoising process accommodates our own learning model, named cross-attention-guided multi-hop autoencoder (CAM-AE), to gradually recover the original user-item interactions. CAM-AE consists of two core modules: 1) the attention-aided AE module, responsible for precisely learning latent representations of user-item interactions while preserving the model's complexity at manageable levels, and 2) the multi-hop cross-attention module, which judiciously harnesses high-order connectivity information to capture enhanced collaborative signals. Through comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that CF-Diff is (a) Superior: outperforming benchmark recommendation methods, achieving remarkable gains up to 7.29% compared to the best competitor, (b) Theoretically-validated: reducing computations while ensuring that the embeddings generated by our model closely approximate those from the original cross-attention, and (c) Scalable: proving the computational efficiency that scales linearly with the number of users or items.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables; 47th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2024) (to appear) (Please cite our conference version.)</p></details> |

However, while the majority of recommendation algorithms proposed in the literature have focused their efforts on improving prediction accuracy, other important aspects of recommendation quality, such as diversity of recommendations, have been more or less overlooked. In the latest decade, recommendation diversity has drawn more research attention, especially in the models based on user-item bipartite networks. In this paper, we introduce a family of approaches to extract fabricated experts from users in RSes, named as the Expert Tracking Approaches (ExTrA for short), and explore the capability of these fabricated experts in improving the recommendation diversity, by highlighting them in a well-known bipartite network-based method, called the Mass Diffusion (MD for short) model. These ExTrA-based models are compared with two state-of-the-art MD-improved models HHP and BHC, with respect to recommendation accuracy and diversity. Comprehensive empirical results on three real-world datasets MovieLens, Netflix and RYM show that, our proposed ExTrA-based models can achieve significant diversity gain while maintain comparable level of recommendation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Resolution Diffusion for Privacy-Sensitive Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03488v4)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recommender systems have become an integral component of the Web experience, their heavy reliance on user data raises privacy and security concerns. Substituting user data with synthetic data can address these concerns, but accurately replicating these real-world datasets has been a notoriously challenging problem. Recent advancements in generative AI have demonstrated the impressive capabilities of diffusion models in generating realistic data across various domains. In this work we introduce a Score-based Diffusion Recommendation Module (SDRM), which captures the intricate patterns of real-world datasets required for training highly accurate recommender systems. SDRM allows for the generation of synthetic data that can replace existing datasets to preserve user privacy, or augment existing datasets to address excessive data sparsity. Our method outperforms competing baselines such as generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, and recently proposed diffusion models in synthesizing various datasets to replace or augment the original data by an average improvement of 4.30% in Recall@k and 4.65% in NDCG@k.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Graph Signal Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08744v3)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative filtering is a critical technique in recommender systems. It has been increasingly viewed as a conditional generative task for user feedback data, where newly developed diffusion model shows great potential. However, existing studies on diffusion model lack effective solutions for modeling implicit feedback. Particularly, the standard isotropic diffusion process overlooks correlation between items, misaligned with the graphical structure of the interaction space. Meanwhile, Gaussian noise destroys personalized information in a user's interaction vector, causing difficulty in its reconstruction. In this paper, we adapt standard diffusion model and propose a novel Graph Signal Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering (named GiffCF). To better represent the correlated distribution of user-item interactions, we define a generalized diffusion process using heat equation on the item-item similarity graph. Our forward process smooths interaction signals with an advanced family of graph filters, introducing the graph adjacency as beneficial prior knowledge for recommendation. Our reverse process iteratively refines and sharpens latent signals in a noise-free manner, where the updates are conditioned on the user's history and computed from a carefully designed two-stage denoiser, leading to high-quality reconstruction. Finally, through extensive experiments, we show that GiffCF effectively leverages the advantages of both diffusion model and graph signal processing, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, accepted by SIGIR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Negative Transfer: Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00389v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) leverages user behaviors across domains to enhance recommendation quality. However, naive aggregation of sequential signals can introduce conflicting domain-specific preferences, leading to negative transfer. While Sequential Recommendation (SR) already suffers from noisy behaviors such as misclicks and impulsive actions, CDSR further amplifies this issue due to domain heterogeneity arising from diverse item types and user intents. The core challenge is disentangling three intertwined signals: domain-invariant preferences, domain-specific preferences, and noise. Diffusion Models (DMs) offer a generative denoising framework well-suited for disentangling complex user preferences and enhancing robustness to noise. Their iterative refinement process enables gradual denoising, making them effective at capturing subtle preference signals. However, existing applications in recommendation face notable limitations: sequential DMs often conflate shared and domain-specific preferences, while cross-domain collaborative filtering DMs neglect temporal dynamics, limiting their ability to model evolving user preferences. To bridge these gaps, we propose \textbf{DPG-Diff}, a novel Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion Model, the first diffusion-based approach tailored for CDSR, to or best knowledge. DPG-Diff decomposes user preferences into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, which jointly guide the reverse diffusion process. This disentangled guidance enables robust cross-domain knowledge transfer, mitigates negative transfer, and filters sequential noise. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPG-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alleviating User-Sensitive bias with Fair Generative Sequential Recommendation Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19777v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation fairness has recently attracted much attention. In the real world, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with the same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same patterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation preference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness. Diffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great success in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and represent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of adaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore, we use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the diversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model based on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the original distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition model, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse reconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is completed by injecting multi-interests representational information that eliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In the inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition by using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to reconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on accuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes the degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Efficiency-Effectiveness Trade-off of Diffusion-based Recommenders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17245v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative sequential recommendation, which typically generate next items to recommend guided by user interaction histories with a multi-step denoising process. However, the multi-step process relies on discrete approximations, introducing discretization error that creates a trade-off between computational efficiency and recommendation effectiveness. To address this trade-off, we propose TA-Rec, a two-stage framework that achieves one-step generation by smoothing the denoising function during pretraining while alleviating trajectory deviation by aligning with user preferences during fine-tuning. Specifically, to improve the efficiency without sacrificing the recommendation performance, TA-Rec pretrains the denoising model with Temporal Consistency Regularization (TCR), enforcing the consistency between the denoising results across adjacent steps. Thus, we can smooth the denoising function to map the noise as oracle items in one step with bounded error. To further enhance effectiveness, TA-Rec introduces Adaptive Preference Alignment (APA) that aligns the denoising process with user preference adaptively based on preference pair similarity and timesteps. Extensive experiments prove that TA-Rec's two-stage objective effectively mitigates the discretization errors-induced trade-off, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion-based recommenders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-based Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09369v5)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has been effectively utilized to enhance the training of sequential recommendation models by leveraging informative self-supervised signals. Most existing approaches generate augmented views of the same user sequence through random augmentation and subsequently maximize their agreement in the representation space. However, these methods often neglect the rationality of the augmented samples. Due to significant uncertainty, random augmentation can disrupt the semantic information and interest evolution patterns inherent in the original user sequences. Moreover, pulling semantically inconsistent sequences closer in the representation space can render the user sequence embeddings insensitive to variations in user preferences, which contradicts the primary objective of sequential recommendation. To address these limitations, we propose the Context-aware Diffusion-based Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation, named CaDiRec. The core idea is to leverage context information to generate more reasonable augmented views. Specifically, CaDiRec employs a context-aware diffusion model to generate alternative items for the given positions within a sequence. These generated items are aligned with their respective context information and can effectively replace the corresponding original items, thereby generating a positive view of the original sequence. By considering two different augmentations of the same user sequence, we can construct a pair of positive samples for contrastive learning. To ensure representation cohesion, we train the entire framework in an end-to-end manner, with shared item embeddings between the diffusion model and the recommendation model. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method over existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a full paper in CIKM'2024</p></details> |
| **[Graph-based Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05029v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based recommendation methods have achieved impressive results. However, existing approaches predominantly treat each user's historical interactions as independent training samples, overlooking the potential of higher-order collaborative signals between users and items. Such signals, which encapsulate richer and more nuanced relationships, can be naturally captured using graph-based data structures. To address this limitation, we extend diffusion-based recommendation methods to the graph domain by directly modeling user-item bipartite graphs with diffusion models. This enables better modeling of the higher-order connectivity inherent in complex interaction dynamics. However, this extension introduces two primary challenges: (1) Noise Heterogeneity, where interactions are influenced by various forms of continuous and discrete noise, and (2) Relation Explosion, referring to the high computational costs of processing large-scale graphs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Graph-based Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering (GDMCF). To address noise heterogeneity, we introduce a multi-level noise corruption mechanism that integrates both continuous and discrete noise, effectively simulating real-world interaction complexities. To mitigate relation explosion, we design a user-active guided diffusion process that selectively focuses on the most meaningful edges and active users, reducing inference costs while preserving the graph's topological integrity. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GDMCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing higher-order collaborative signals and improving recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Cloud-Edge-Device Collaborative Learning for Next POI Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13811v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) has highlighted the importance of effective next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendations, which leverage historical check-in data to predict users' next POIs to visit. Traditional centralized deep neural networks (DNNs) offer impressive POI recommendation performance but face challenges due to privacy concerns and limited timeliness. In response, on-device POI recommendations have been introduced, utilizing federated learning (FL) and decentralized approaches to ensure privacy and recommendation timeliness. However, these methods often suffer from computational strain on devices and struggle to adapt to new users and regions. This paper introduces a novel collaborative learning framework, Diffusion-Based Cloud-Edge-Device Collaborative Learning for Next POI Recommendations (DCPR), leveraging the diffusion model known for its success across various domains. DCPR operates with a cloud-edge-device architecture to offer region-specific and highly personalized POI recommendations while reducing on-device computational burdens. DCPR minimizes on-device computational demands through a unique blend of global and local learning processes. Our evaluation with two real-world datasets demonstrates DCPR's superior performance in recommendation accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability to new users and regions, marking a significant step forward in on-device POI recommendation technology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-Guided Diffusion Sampling for Long-Term User Behavior Prediction in Reinforcement Learning-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12815v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning-based recommender systems (RL4RS) have gained attention for their ability to adapt to dynamic user preferences. However, these systems face challenges, particularly in offline settings, where data inefficiency and reliance on pre-collected trajectories limit their broader applicability. While offline reinforcement learning methods leverage extensive datasets to address these issues, they often struggle with noisy data and fail to capture long-term user preferences, resulting in suboptimal recommendation policies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diffusion-enhanced Actor-Critic for Offline RL4RS (DAC4Rec), a novel framework that integrates diffusion processes with reinforcement learning to model complex user preferences more effectively. DAC4Rec leverages the denoising capabilities of diffusion models to enhance the robustness of offline RL algorithms and incorporates a Q-value-guided policy optimization strategy to better handle suboptimal trajectories. Additionally, we introduce an energy-based sampling strategy to reduce randomness during recommendation generation, ensuring more targeted and reliable outcomes. We validate the effectiveness of DAC4Rec through extensive experiments on six real-world offline datasets and in an online simulation environment, demonstrating its ability to optimize long-term user preferences. Furthermore, we show that the proposed diffusion policy can be seamlessly integrated into other commonly used RL algorithms in RL4RS, highlighting its versatility and wide applicability.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |

Effectively integrating diverse user behavior patterns with rich multimodal information of items to enhance the accuracy of sequential recommendations is an emerging and challenging research direction. This paper focuses on the problem of multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation, aiming to address the following challenges: (1) the lack of effective characterization of modal preferences across different behaviors, as user attention to different item modalities varies depending on the behavior; (2) the difficulty of effectively mitigating implicit noise in user behavior, such as unintended actions like accidental clicks; (3) the inability to handle modality noise in multi-modal representations, which further impacts the accurate modeling of user preferences. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation model (M$^3$BSR). This model first removes noise in multi-modal representations using a Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer. Subsequently, it utilizes deep behavioral information to guide the denoising of shallow behavioral data, thereby alleviating the impact of noise in implicit feedback through Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising. Finally, by introducing a Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer, M$^3$BSR explicitly models the common and specific interests across behaviors and modalities to enhance recommendation performance. Experimental results indicate that M$^3$BSR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.</p></details> | SIGIR 2025 |
| **[Leveraging Multimodal Data and Side Users for Diffusion Cross-Domain Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04000v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to address the persistent cold-start problem in Recommender Systems. Current CDR research concentrates on transferring cold-start users' information from the auxiliary domain to the target domain. However, these systems face two main issues: the underutilization of multimodal data, which hinders effective cross-domain alignment, and the neglect of side users who interact solely within the target domain, leading to inadequate learning of the target domain's vector space distribution. To address these issues, we propose a model leveraging Multimodal data and Side users for diffusion Cross-domain recommendation (MuSiC). We first employ a multimodal large language model to extract item multimodal features and leverage a large language model to uncover user features using prompt learning without fine-tuning. Secondly, we propose the cross-domain diffusion module to learn the generation of feature vectors in the target domain. This approach involves learning feature distribution from side users and understanding the patterns in cross-domain transformation through overlapping users. Subsequently, the trained diffusion module is used to generate feature vectors for cold-start users in the target domain, enabling the completion of cross-domain recommendation tasks. Finally, our experimental evaluation of the Amazon dataset confirms that MuSiC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming all selected baselines. Our code is available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MuSiC-310A/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity-Guided Diffusion for Contrastive Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11866v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In sequential recommendation systems, data augmentation and contrastive learning techniques have recently been introduced using diffusion models to achieve robust representation learning. However, most of the existing approaches use random augmentation, which risk damaging the contextual information of the original sequence. Accordingly, we propose a Similarity-Guided Diffusion for Contrastive Sequential Recommendation. Our method leverages the similarity between item embedding vectors to generate semantically consistent noise. Moreover, we utilize high confidence score in the denoising process to select our augmentation positions. This approach more effectively reflects contextual and structural information compared to augmentation at random positions. From a contrastive learning perspective, the proposed augmentation technique provides more discriminative positive and negative samples, simultaneously improving training efficiency and recommendation performance. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that SimDiffRec outperforms the existing baseline models.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DiffCL: A Diffusion-Based Contrastive Learning Framework with Semantic Alignment for Multimodal Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01066v1)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation systems integrate diverse multimodal information into the feature representations of both items and users, thereby enabling a more comprehensive modeling of user preferences. However, existing methods are hindered by data sparsity and the inherent noise within multimodal data, which impedes the accurate capture of users' interest preferences. Additionally, discrepancies in the semantic representations of items across different modalities can adversely impact the prediction accuracy of recommendation models. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel diffusion-based contrastive learning framework (DiffCL) for multimodal recommendation. DiffCL employs a diffusion model to generate contrastive views that effectively mitigate the impact of noise during the contrastive learning phase. Furthermore, it improves semantic consistency across modalities by aligning distinct visual and textual semantic information through stable ID embeddings. Finally, the introduction of the Item-Item Graph enhances multimodal feature representations, thereby alleviating the adverse effects of data sparsity on the overall system performance. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the DiffCL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generate and Instantiate What You Prefer: Text-Guided Diffusion for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13428v3)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative recommendation systems, particularly in the realm of sequential recommendation tasks, have shown promise in enhancing generalization to new items. Among these approaches, diffusion-based generative recommendation has emerged as an effective tool, leveraging its ability to capture data distributions and generate high-quality samples. Despite effectiveness, two primary challenges have been identified: 1) the lack of consistent modeling of data distribution for oracle items; and 2) the difficulty in scaling to more informative control signals beyond historical interactions. These issues stem from the uninformative nature of ID embeddings, which necessitate random initialization and limit the incorporation of additional control signals. To address these limitations, we propose iDreamRec to involve more concrete prior knowledge to establish item embeddings, particularly through detailed item text descriptions and advanced Text Embedding Models (TEM). More importantly, by converting item descriptions into embeddings aligned with TEM, we enable the integration of intention instructions as control signals to guide the generation of oracle items. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that iDreamRec not only outperforms existing diffusion-based generative recommenders but also facilitates the incorporation of intention instructions for more precise and effective recommendation generation.</p></details> |  |

One of their main limitations is that they are typically limited to items already in the catalog. We propose REcommendations BEyond CAtalogs, REBECA, a new class of probabilistic diffusion-based recommender systems that synthesize new items tailored to individual tastes rather than retrieve items from the catalog. REBECA combines efficient training in embedding space with a novel diffusion prior that only requires users' past ratings of items. We evaluate REBECA on real-world data and propose novel personalization metrics for generative recommender systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that REBECA produces high-quality, personalized recommendations, generating images that align with users' unique preferences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing CTR Prediction in Recommendation Domain with Search Query Representation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21487v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many platforms, such as e-commerce websites, offer both search and recommendation services simultaneously to better meet users' diverse needs. Recommendation services suggest items based on user preferences, while search services allow users to search for items before providing recommendations. Since users and items are often shared between the search and recommendation domains, there is a valuable opportunity to enhance the recommendation domain by leveraging user preferences extracted from the search domain. Existing approaches either overlook the shift in user intention between these domains or fail to capture the significant impact of learning from users' search queries on understanding their interests. In this paper, we propose a framework that learns from user search query embeddings within the context of user preferences in the recommendation domain. Specifically, user search query sequences from the search domain are used to predict the items users will click at the next time point in the recommendation domain. Additionally, the relationship between queries and items is explored through contrastive learning. To address issues of data sparsity, the diffusion model is incorporated to infer positive items the user will select after searching with certain queries in a denoising manner, which is particularly effective in preventing false positives. Effectively extracting this information, the queries are integrated into click-through rate prediction in the recommendation domain. Experimental analysis demonstrates that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models in the recommendation domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2024 Full Research Track</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Learn a Cold-start Sequential Recommender](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.09083v1)** | 2021-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cold-start recommendation is an urgent problem in contemporary online applications. It aims to provide users whose behaviors are literally sparse with as accurate recommendations as possible. Many data-driven algorithms, such as the widely used matrix factorization, underperform because of data sparseness. This work adopts the idea of meta-learning to solve the user's cold-start recommendation problem. We propose a meta-learning based cold-start sequential recommendation framework called metaCSR, including three main components: Diffusion Representer for learning better user/item embedding through information diffusion on the interaction graph; Sequential Recommender for capturing temporal dependencies of behavior sequences; Meta Learner for extracting and propagating transferable knowledge of prior users and learning a good initialization for new users. metaCSR holds the ability to learn the common patterns from regular users' behaviors and optimize the initialization so that the model can quickly adapt to new users after one or a few gradient updates to achieve optimal performance. The extensive quantitative experiments on three widely-used datasets show the remarkable performance of metaCSR in dealing with user cold-start problem. Meanwhile, a series of qualitative analysis demonstrates that the proposed metaCSR has good generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Cross-domain Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02182v1)** | 2024-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is always a challenge for recommender systems to give high-quality outcomes to cold-start users. One potential solution to alleviate the data sparsity problem for cold-start users in the target domain is to add data from the auxiliary domain. Finding a proper way to extract knowledge from an auxiliary domain and transfer it into a target domain is one of the main objectives for cross-domain recommendation (CDR) research. Among the existing methods, mapping approach is a popular one to implement cross-domain recommendation models (CDRs). For models of this type, a mapping module plays the role of transforming data from one domain to another. It primarily determines the performance of mapping approach CDRs. Recently, diffusion probability models (DPMs) have achieved impressive success for image synthesis related tasks. They involve recovering images from noise-added samples, which can be viewed as a data transformation process with outstanding performance. To further enhance the performance of CDRs, we first reveal the potential connection between DPMs and mapping modules of CDRs, and then propose a novel CDR model named Diffusion Cross-domain Recommendation (DiffCDR). More specifically, we first adopt the theory of DPM and design a Diffusion Module (DIM), which generates user's embedding in target domain. To reduce the negative impact of randomness introduced in DIM and improve the stability, we employ an Alignment Module to produce the aligned user embeddings. In addition, we consider the label data of the target domain and form the task-oriented loss function, which enables our DiffCDR to adapt to specific tasks. By conducting extensive experiments on datasets collected from reality, we demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of DiffCDR to outperform baseline models on various CDR tasks in both cold-start and warm-start scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing User Preferences by Social Networks: A Condition-Guided Social Recommendation Model for Mitigating Popularity Bias](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16772v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social recommendation models weave social interactions into their design to provide uniquely personalized recommendation results for users. However, social networks not only amplify the popularity bias in recommendation models, resulting in more frequent recommendation of hot items and fewer long-tail items, but also include a substantial amount of redundant information that is essentially meaningless for the model's performance. Existing social recommendation models fail to address the issues of popularity bias and the redundancy of social information, as they directly characterize social influence across the entire social network without making targeted adjustments. In this paper, we propose a Condition-Guided Social Recommendation Model (named CGSoRec) to mitigate the model's popularity bias by denoising the social network and adjusting the weights of user's social preferences. More specifically, CGSoRec first includes a Condition-Guided Social Denoising Model (CSD) to remove redundant social relations in the social network for capturing users' social preferences with items more precisely. Then, CGSoRec calculates users' social preferences based on denoised social network and adjusts the weights in users' social preferences to make them can counteract the popularity bias present in the recommendation model. At last, CGSoRec includes a Condition-Guided Diffusion Recommendation Model (CGD) to introduce the adjusted social preferences as conditions to control the recommendation results for a debiased direction. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is in: https://github.com/hexin5515/CGSoRec.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Preference Diffusion for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13117v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems predict personalized item rankings based on user preference distributions derived from historical behavior data. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have gained attention in recommendation for their ability to model complex distributions, yet current DM-based recommenders often rely on traditional objectives like mean squared error (MSE) or recommendation objectives, which are not optimized for personalized ranking tasks or fail to fully leverage DM's generative potential. To address this, we propose PreferDiff, a tailored optimization objective for DM-based recommenders. PreferDiff transforms BPR into a log-likelihood ranking objective and integrates multiple negative samples to better capture user preferences. Specifically, we employ variational inference to handle the intractability through minimizing the variational upper bound and replaces MSE with cosine error to improve alignment with recommendation tasks. Finally, we balance learning generation and preference to enhance the training stability of DMs. PreferDiff offers three key benefits: it is the first personalized ranking loss designed specifically for DM-based recommenders and it improves ranking and faster convergence by addressing hard negatives. We also prove that it is theoretically connected to Direct Preference Optimization which indicates that it has the potential to align user preferences in DM-based recommenders via generative modeling. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks validate its superior recommendation performance and commendable general sequential recommendation capabilities.

| **[A novel diffusion recommendation algorithm based on multi-scale cnn and residual lstm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10885v2)** | 2023-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation aims to infer user preferences from historical interaction sequences and predict the next item that users may be interested in the future. The current mainstream design approach is to represent items as fixed vectors, capturing the underlying relationships between items and user preferences based on the order of interactions. However, relying on a single fixed-item embedding may weaken the modeling capability of the system, and the global dynamics and local saliency exhibited by user preferences need to be distinguished. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel diffusion recommendation algorithm based on multi-scale cnn and residual lstm (AREAL). We introduce diffusion models into the recommend system, representing items as probability distributions instead of fixed vectors. This approach enables adaptive reflection of multiple aspects of the items and generates item distributions in a denoising manner. We use multi-scale cnn and residual lstm methods to extract the local and global dependency features of user history interactions, and use attention mechanism to distinguish weights as the guide features of reverse diffusion recovery. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experiments conducted on two real-world datasets. Specifically, AREAL obtains improvements over the best baselines by 2.63% and 4.25% in terms of HR@20 and 5.05% and 3.94% in terms of NDCG@20 on all datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper needs to be further modified, including the ablation experiment, model framework and other information in Chapter 5.

However, a clear concern is that a model focusing excessively on one measure will put the other one at risk, thus it is not easy to greatly improve diversity and accuracy simultaneously. In this paper, we propose to enhance the Resource-Allocation (RA) similarity in resource transfer equations of diffusion-like models, by giving a tunable exponent to the RA similarity, and traversing the value of the exponent to achieve the optimal recommendation results. In this way, we can increase the recommendation scores (allocated resource) of many unpopular objects. Experiments on three benchmark data sets, MovieLens, Netflix, and RateYourMusic show that the modified models can yield remarkable performance improvement compared with the original ones.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate data sparsity and interest drift issues, conventional approaches typically incorporate auxiliary behaviors from other domains via cross-domain transition. However, existing cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) methods often follow an align-then-fusion paradigm that performs representation-level alignment across multiple domains and combines them mechanically for recommendation, overlooking the fine-grained fusion of domain-specific preferences. Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) for distribution matching, we propose an align-for-fusion framework for CDSR to harmonize triple preferences via dual-oriented DMs, termed HorizonRec. Specifically, we investigate the uncertainty injection of DMs and identify stochastic noise as a key source of instability in existing DM-based recommenders. To address this, we introduce a mixed-conditioned distribution retrieval strategy that leverages distributions retrieved from users' authentic behavioral logic as semantic bridges across domains, enabling consistent multi-domain preference modeling. Furthermore, we propose a dual-oriented preference diffusion method to suppress potential noise and emphasize target-relevant interests during multi-domain user representation fusion. Extensive experiments on four CDSR datasets from two distinct platforms demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of HorizonRec in fine-grained triple-domain preference fusion.</p></details> |  |

The candidate corpus usually consists of a finite set of items that are ready to be served, such as videos, products, or articles. With recent advances in Generative AI such as GPT and Diffusion models, a new form of recommendation task is yet to be explored where items are to be created by generative models with personalized prompts. Taking image generation as an example, with a single prompt from the user and access to a generative model, it is possible to generate hundreds of new images in a few minutes. How shall we attain personalization in the presence of "infinite" items? In this preliminary study, we propose a two-stage framework, namely Prompt-Model Retrieval and Generated Item Ranking, to approach this new task formulation. We release GEMRec-18K, a prompt-model interaction dataset with 18K images generated by 200 publicly-available generative models paired with a diverse set of 90 textual prompts. Our findings demonstrate the promise of generative model recommendation as a novel personalization problem and the limitations of existing evaluation metrics.

It captures the most recent co-occurrence information of items by considering the interaction time. However, it neglects the co-occurrence information of items in the historical behavior which is interacted earlier and cannot discriminate the impact of items and sessions with different popularity. Due to these observations, this paper presents a new contextual KNN approach to address these issues for session-based recommendation. Specifically, a diffusion-based similarity method is proposed for considering the popularity of vertices in session-item bipartite network, and a candidate selection method is proposed to capture the items that are co-occurred with different historical clicked items in the same session efficiently. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our KNN approach over the state-of-the-art KNN approach for session-based recommendation on three benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

By exploring the virtue of rich node features and link information, GNN is designed to provide personalized and accurate suggestions. Meanwhile, the privacy leakage of GNN in such contexts has also captured special attention. Prior work has revealed that a malicious user can utilize auxiliary knowledge to extract sensitive link data of the target graph, integral to recommendation systems, via the decision made by the target GNN model. This poses a significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of data used in recommendation system. Though important, previous works on GNN's privacy leakage are still challenged in three aspects, i.e., limited stealing attack scenarios, sub-optimal attack performance, and adaptation against defense. To address these issues, we propose a diffusion model based link stealing attack, named DM4Steal. It differs previous work from three critical aspects. (i) Generality: aiming at six attack scenarios with limited auxiliary knowledge, we propose a novel training strategy for diffusion models so that DM4Steal is transferable to diverse attack scenarios. (ii) Effectiveness: benefiting from the retention of semantic structure in the diffusion model during the training process, DM4Steal is capable to learn the precise topology of the target graph through the GNN decision process. (iii) Adaptation: when GNN is defensive (e.g., DP, Dropout), DM4Steal relies on the stability that comes from sampling the score model multiple times to keep performance degradation to a minimum, thus DM4Steal implements successful adaptive attack on defensive GNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>We fo...</summary><p>We found that there were critical problems in our paper, and we needed to redo the experiment, which was incomplete</p></details> |
| **[Dual-domain Collaborative Denoising for Social Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04942v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social recommendation leverages social network to complement user-item interaction data for recommendation task, aiming to mitigate the data sparsity issue in recommender systems. However, existing social recommendation methods encounter the following challenge: both social network and interaction data contain substaintial noise, and the propagation of such noise through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) not only fails to enhance recommendation performance but may also interfere with the model's normal training. Despite the importance of denoising for social network and interaction data, only a limited number of studies have considered the denoising for social network and all of them overlook that for interaction data, hindering the denoising effect and recommendation performance. Based on this, we propose a novel model called Dual-domain Collaborative Denoising for Social Recommendation ($\textbf{DCDSR}$). DCDSR comprises two primary modules: the structure-level collaborative denoising module and the embedding-space collaborative denoising module. In the structure-level collaborative denoising module, information from interaction domain is first employed to guide social network denoising. Subsequently, the denoised social network is used to supervise the denoising for interaction data. The embedding-space collaborative denoising module devotes to resisting the noise cross-domain diffusion problem through contrastive learning with dual-domain embedding collaborative perturbation. Additionally, a novel contrastive learning strategy, named Anchor-InfoNCE, is introduced to better harness the denoising capability of contrastive learning.

However, two prominent generative models, namely Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs), exhibit challenges that impede achieving optimal performance in sequential recommendation tasks. Specifically, GANs suffer from unstable optimization, while VAEs are prone to posterior collapse and over-smoothed generations. The sparse and noisy nature of sequential recommendation further exacerbates these issues. In response to these limitations, we present a conditional denoising diffusion model, which includes a sequence encoder, a cross-attentive denoising decoder, and a step-wise diffuser. This approach streamlines the optimization and generation process by dividing it into easier and tractable steps in a conditional autoregressive manner. Furthermore, we introduce a novel optimization schema that incorporates both cross-divergence loss and contrastive loss. This novel training schema enables the model to generate high-quality sequence/item representations and meanwhile precluding collapse. We conducted comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and the superior performance achieved by our model attests to its efficacy.</p></details> |  |

| **[Leveraging tagging and rating for recommendation: RMF meets weighted diffusion on tripartite graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00812v1)** | 2017-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RSs) have been a widely exploited approach to solving the information overload problem. However, the performance is still limited due to the extreme sparsity of the rating data. With the popularity of Web 2.0, the social tagging system provides more external information to improve recommendation accuracy. Although some existing approaches combine the matrix factorization models with co-occurrence properties and context of tags, they neglect the issue of tag sparsity without the commonly associated tags problem that would also result in inaccurate recommendations. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a novel hybrid collaborative filtering model named WUDiff_RMF, which improves Regularized Matrix Factorization (RMF) model by integrating Weighted User-Diffusion-based CF algorithm(WUDiff) that obtains the information of similar users from the weighted tripartite user-item-tag graph. This model aims to capture the degree correlation of the user-item-tag tripartite network to enhance the performance of recommendation. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly performs better than already widely used methods in the accuracy of recommendation. Moreover, results show that WUDiff_RMF can alleviate the data sparsity, especially in the circumstance that users have made few ratings and few tags.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distinguished Quantized Guidance for Diffusion-based Sequence Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17670v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as promising approaches for sequential recommendation due to their strong ability to model data distributions and generate high-quality items. Existing work typically adds noise to the next item and progressively denoises it guided by the user's interaction sequence, generating items that closely align with user interests. However, we identify two key issues in this paradigm. First, the sequences are often heterogeneous in length and content, exhibiting noise due to stochastic user behaviors. Using such sequences as guidance may hinder DMs from accurately understanding user interests. Second, DMs are prone to data bias and tend to generate only the popular items that dominate the training dataset, thus failing to meet the personalized needs of different users. To address these issues, we propose Distinguished Quantized Guidance for Diffusion-based Sequence Recommendation (DiQDiff), which aims to extract robust guidance to understand user interests and generate distinguished items for personalized user interests within DMs. To extract robust guidance, DiQDiff introduces Semantic Vector Quantization (SVQ) to quantize sequences into semantic vectors (e.g., collaborative signals and category interests) using a codebook, which can enrich the guidance to better understand user interests. To generate distinguished items, DiQDiff personalizes the generation through Contrastive Discrepancy Maximization (CDM), which maximizes the distance between denoising trajectories using contrastive loss to prevent biased generation for different users. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare DiQDiff with multiple baseline models across four widely-used datasets. The superior recommendation performance of DiQDiff against leading approaches demonstrates its effectiveness in sequential recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Preference-Guided Denoising for Graph based Social Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08346v1)** | 2023-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Network(GNN) based social recommendation models improve the prediction accuracy of user preference by leveraging GNN in exploiting preference similarity contained in social relations. However, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency of recommendation, a large portion of social relations can be redundant or even noisy, e.g., it is quite normal that friends share no preference in a certain domain. Existing models do not fully solve this problem of relation redundancy and noise, as they directly characterize social influence over the full social network. In this paper, we instead propose to improve graph based social recommendation by only retaining the informative social relations to ensure an efficient and effective influence diffusion, i.e., graph denoising. Our designed denoising method is preference-guided to model social relation confidence and benefits user preference learning in return by providing a denoised but more informative social graph for recommendation models. Moreover, to avoid interference of noisy social relations, it designs a self-correcting curriculum learning module and an adaptive denoising strategy, both favoring highly-confident samples. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate its consistent capability of improving two state-of-the-art social recommendation models by robustly removing 10-40% of original relations.

| **[Diffusion-augmented Graph Contrastive Learning for Collaborative Filter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16290v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based collaborative filtering has been established as a prominent approach in recommendation systems, leveraging the inherent graph topology of user-item interactions to model high-order connectivity patterns and enhance recommendation performance. Recent advances in Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) have demonstrated promising potential to alleviate data sparsity issues by improving representation learning through contrastive view generation and mutual information maximization. However, existing approaches lack effective data augmentation strategies. Structural augmentation risks distorting fundamental graph topology, while feature-level perturbation techniques predominantly employ uniform noise scales that fail to account for node-specific characteristics. To solve these challenges, we propose Diffusion-augmented Contrastive Learning (DGCL), an innovative framework that integrates diffusion models with contrastive learning for enhanced collaborative filtering. Our approach employs a diffusion process that learns node-specific Gaussian distributions of representations, thereby generating semantically consistent yet diversified contrastive views through reverse diffusion sampling. DGCL facilitates adaptive data augmentation based on reconstructed representations, considering both semantic coherence and node-specific features. In addition, it explores unrepresented regions of the latent sparse feature space, thereby enriching the diversity of contrastive views. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DGCL on three public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[HI-Series Algorithms A Hybrid of Substance Diffusion Algorithm and Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01305v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems face the challenge of balancing accuracy and diversity, as traditional collaborative filtering (CF) and network-based diffusion algorithms exhibit complementary limitations. While item-based CF (ItemCF) enhances diversity through item similarity, it compromises accuracy. Conversely, mass diffusion (MD) algorithms prioritize accuracy by favoring popular items but lack diversity. To address this trade-off, we propose the HI-series algorithms, hybrid models integrating ItemCF with diffusion-based approaches (MD, HHP, BHC, BD) through a nonlinear combination controlled by parameter $ε$. This hybridization leverages ItemCF's diversity and MD's accuracy, extending to advanced diffusion models (HI-HHP, HI-BHC, HI-BD) for enhanced performance. Experiments on MovieLens, Netflix, and RYM datasets demonstrate that HI-series algorithms significantly outperform their base counterparts. In sparse data ($20\%$ training), HI-MD achieves a $0.8\%$-$4.4\%$ improvement in F1-score over MD while maintaining higher diversity (Diversity@20: 459 vs. 396 on MovieLens). For dense data ($80\%$ training), HI-BD improves F1-score by $2.3\%$-$5.2\%$ compared to BD, with diversity gains up to $18.6\%$. Notably, hybrid models consistently enhance novelty in sparse settings and exhibit robust parameter adaptability. The results validate that strategic hybridization effectively breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, offering a flexible framework for optimizing recommendation systems across data sparsity levels.</p></details> |  |

| **[Factorized Multimodal Transformer for Multimodal Sequential Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09826v1)** | 2019-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complex world around us is inherently multimodal and sequential (continuous). Information is scattered across different modalities and requires multiple continuous sensors to be captured. As machine learning leaps towards better generalization to real world, multimodal sequential learning becomes a fundamental research area. Arguably, modeling arbitrarily distributed spatio-temporal dynamics within and across modalities is the biggest challenge in this research area. In this paper, we present a new transformer model, called the Factorized Multimodal Transformer (FMT) for multimodal sequential learning. FMT inherently models the intramodal and intermodal (involving two or more modalities) dynamics within its multimodal input in a factorized manner. The proposed factorization allows for increasing the number of self-attentions to better model the multimodal phenomena at hand; without encountering difficulties during training (e.g. overfitting) even on relatively low-resource setups. All the attention mechanisms within FMT have a full time-domain receptive field which allows them to asynchronously capture long-range multimodal dynamics. In our experiments we focus on datasets that contain the three commonly studied modalities of language, vision and acoustic. We perform a wide range of experiments, spanning across 3 well-studied datasets and 21 distinct labels. FMT shows superior performance over previously proposed models, setting new state of the art in the studied datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Robust Multimodal Learning using Multimodal Foundational Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13697v1)** | 2024-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multimodal sentiment analysis tasks are highly rely on the assumption that the training and test sets are complete multimodal data, while this assumption can be difficult to hold: the multimodal data are often incomplete in real-world scenarios. Therefore, a robust multimodal model in scenarios with randomly missing modalities is highly preferred. Recently, CLIP-based multimodal foundational models have demonstrated impressive performance on numerous multimodal tasks by learning the aligned cross-modal semantics of image and text pairs, but the multimodal foundational models are also unable to directly address scenarios involving modality absence. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple and effective framework, namely TRML, Toward Robust Multimodal Learning using Multimodal Foundational Models. TRML employs generated virtual modalities to replace missing modalities, and aligns the semantic spaces between the generated and missing modalities. Concretely, we design a missing modality inference module to generate virtual modaliites and replace missing modalities. We also design a semantic matching learning module to align semantic spaces generated and missing modalities. Under the prompt of complete modality, our model captures the semantics of missing modalities by leveraging the aligned cross-modal semantic space. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach on three multimodal sentiment analysis benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and MELD.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Multimodal Reasoning with Multimodal Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02030v2)** | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often suffers from hallucinations and the presence of deficient or outdated knowledge within LLMs. Some approaches have sought to mitigate these issues by employing textual knowledge graphs, but their singular modality of knowledge limits comprehensive cross-modal understanding. In this paper, we propose the Multimodal Reasoning with Multimodal Knowledge Graph (MR-MKG) method, which leverages multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) to learn rich and semantic knowledge across modalities, significantly enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In particular, a relation graph attention network is utilized for encoding MMKGs and a cross-modal alignment module is designed for optimizing image-text alignment. A MMKG-grounded dataset is constructed to equip LLMs with initial expertise in multimodal reasoning through pretraining. Remarkably, MR-MKG achieves superior performance while training on only a small fraction of parameters, approximately 2.25% of the LLM's parameter size. Experimental results on multimodal question answering and multimodal analogy reasoning tasks demonstrate that our MR-MKG method outperforms previous state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2024 (Main Conference)</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Transformer for Unaligned Multimodal Language Sequences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00295v1)** | 2019-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human language is often multimodal, which comprehends a mixture of natural language, facial gestures, and acoustic behaviors. However, two major challenges in modeling such multimodal human language time-series data exist: 1) inherent data non-alignment due to variable sampling rates for the sequences from each modality; and 2) long-range dependencies between elements across modalities. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Transformer (MulT) to generically address the above issues in an end-to-end manner without explicitly aligning the data. At the heart of our model is the directional pairwise crossmodal attention, which attends to interactions between multimodal sequences across distinct time steps and latently adapt streams from one modality to another. Comprehensive experiments on both aligned and non-aligned multimodal time-series show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. In addition, empirical analysis suggests that correlated crossmodal signals are able to be captured by the proposed crossmodal attention mechanism in MulT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Knowledge Expansion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14431v3)** | 2021-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The popularity of multimodal sensors and the accessibility of the Internet have brought us a massive amount of unlabeled multimodal data. Since existing datasets and well-trained models are primarily unimodal, the modality gap between a unimodal network and unlabeled multimodal data poses an interesting problem: how to transfer a pre-trained unimodal network to perform the same task on unlabeled multimodal data? In this work, we propose multimodal knowledge expansion (MKE), a knowledge distillation-based framework to effectively utilize multimodal data without requiring labels. Opposite to traditional knowledge distillation, where the student is designed to be lightweight and inferior to the teacher, we observe that a multimodal student model consistently denoises pseudo labels and generalizes better than its teacher. Extensive experiments on four tasks and different modalities verify this finding. Furthermore, we connect the mechanism of MKE to semi-supervised learning and offer both empirical and theoretical explanations to understand the denoising capability of a multimodal student.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2021.

| **[Dynamic Multimodal Fusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00102v2)** | 2023-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep multimodal learning has achieved great progress in recent years. However, current fusion approaches are static in nature, i.e., they process and fuse multimodal inputs with identical computation, without accounting for diverse computational demands of different multimodal data. In this work, we propose dynamic multimodal fusion (DynMM), a new approach that adaptively fuses multimodal data and generates data-dependent forward paths during inference. To this end, we propose a gating function to provide modality-level or fusion-level decisions on-the-fly based on multimodal features and a resource-aware loss function that encourages computational efficiency. Results on various multimodal tasks demonstrate the efficiency and wide applicability of our approach. For instance, DynMM can reduce the computation costs by 46.5% with only a negligible accuracy loss (CMU-MOSEI sentiment analysis) and improve segmentation performance with over 21% savings in computation (NYU Depth V2 semantic segmentation) when compared with static fusion approaches. We believe our approach opens a new direction towards dynamic multimodal network design, with applications to a wide range of multimodal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 6th Multi-Modal Learning and Applications Workshop (MULA), CVPR 2023.

However, understanding long multimodal content, as a foundational ability for real-world applications, remains underexplored. In this work, we present Needle In A Multimodal Haystack (MM-NIAH), the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate the capability of existing MLLMs to comprehend long multimodal documents. Our benchmark includes three types of evaluation tasks: multimodal retrieval, counting, and reasoning. In each task, the model is required to answer the questions according to different key information scattered throughout the given multimodal document. Evaluating the leading MLLMs on MM-NIAH, we observe that existing models still have significant room for improvement on these tasks, especially on vision-centric evaluation. We hope this work can provide a platform for further research on long multimodal document comprehension and contribute to the advancement of MLLMs. Code and benchmark are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/MM-NIAH.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024 Track Datasets and Benchmarks</p></details> |
| **[MM-Embed: Universal Multimodal Retrieval with Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02571v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art retrieval models typically address a straightforward search scenario, in which retrieval tasks are fixed (e.g., finding a passage to answer a specific question) and only a single modality is supported for both queries and retrieved results. This paper introduces techniques for advancing information retrieval with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling a broader search scenario, termed universal multimodal retrieval, where multiple modalities and diverse retrieval tasks are accommodated. To this end, we first study fine-tuning an MLLM as a bi-encoder retriever on 10 datasets with 16 retrieval tasks. Our empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLM retriever is capable of understanding challenging queries, composed of both text and image, but it underperforms compared to a smaller CLIP retriever in cross-modal retrieval tasks due to the modality bias exhibited by MLLMs. To address the issue, we propose modality-aware hard negative mining to mitigate the modality bias exhibited by MLLM retrievers. Second, we propose continuously fine-tuning the universal multimodal retriever to enhance its text retrieval capability while preserving multimodal retrieval capability. As a result, our model, MM-Embed, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multimodal retrieval benchmark M-BEIR, which spans multiple domains and tasks, while also surpassing the state-of-the-art text retrieval model, NV-Embed-v1, on the MTEB retrieval benchmark. We also explore prompting the off-the-shelf MLLMs as zero-shot rerankers to refine the ranking of the candidates from the multimodal retriever. We find that, through prompt-and-reranking, MLLMs can further improve multimodal retrieval when the user queries (e.g., text-image composed queries) are more complex and challenging to understand. These findings also pave the way for advancing universal multimodal retrieval in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

| **[On the Computational Benefit of Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13782v2)** | 2023-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human perception inherently operates in a multimodal manner. Similarly, as machines interpret the empirical world, their learning processes ought to be multimodal. The recent, remarkable successes in empirical multimodal learning underscore the significance of understanding this paradigm. Yet, a solid theoretical foundation for multimodal learning has eluded the field for some time. While a recent study by Lu (2023) has shown the superior sample complexity of multimodal learning compared to its unimodal counterpart, another basic question remains: does multimodal learning also offer computational advantages over unimodal learning? This work initiates a study on the computational benefit of multimodal learning. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions, multimodal learning can outpace unimodal learning exponentially in terms of computation. Specifically, we present a learning task that is NP-hard for unimodal learning but is solvable in polynomial time by a multimodal algorithm. Our construction is based on a novel modification to the intersection of two half-spaces problem.</p></details> | ALT 2024, to appear |

However, traditional aggregation-based multimodal fusion methods ignore the inter-modality relationship, treat each modality equally, suffer sensor noise, and thus reduce multimodal learning performance. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal contrastive method to explore more reliable multimodal representations under the weak supervision of unimodal predicting. Specifically, we first capture task-related unimodal representations and the unimodal predictions from the introduced unimodal predicting task. Then the unimodal representations are aligned with the more effective one by the designed multimodal contrastive method under the supervision of the unimodal predictions. Experimental results with fused features on two image-text classification benchmarks UPMC-Food-101 and N24News show that our proposed Unimodality-Supervised MultiModal Contrastive UniS-MMC learning method outperforms current state-of-the-art multimodal methods. The detailed ablation study and analysis further demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.</p></details> | ACL 2023 Findings |

| **[Multi-scale Cooperative Multimodal Transformers for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis in Videos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07981v2)** | 2022-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal sentiment analysis in videos is a key task in many real-world applications, which usually requires integrating multimodal streams including visual, verbal and acoustic behaviors. To improve the robustness of multimodal fusion, some of the existing methods let different modalities communicate with each other and modal the crossmodal interaction via transformers. However, these methods only use the single-scale representations during the interaction but forget to exploit multi-scale representations that contain different levels of semantic information. As a result, the representations learned by transformers could be biased especially for unaligned multimodal data. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale cooperative multimodal transformer (MCMulT) architecture for multimodal sentiment analysis. On the whole, the "multi-scale" mechanism is capable of exploiting the different levels of semantic information of each modality which are used for fine-grained crossmodal interactions. Meanwhile, each modality learns its feature hierarchies via integrating the crossmodal interactions from multiple level features of its source modality. In this way, each pair of modalities progressively builds feature hierarchies respectively in a cooperative manner. The empirical results illustrate that our MCMulT model not only outperforms existing approaches on unaligned multimodal sequences but also has strong performance on aligned multimodal sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-shot Multimodal Sentiment Analysis based on Multimodal Probabilistic Fusion Prompts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06607v2)** | 2023-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal sentiment analysis has gained significant attention due to the proliferation of multimodal content on social media. However, existing studies in this area rely heavily on large-scale supervised data, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect. Thus, there is a need to address the challenge of few-shot multimodal sentiment analysis. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method called Multimodal Probabilistic Fusion Prompts (MultiPoint) that leverages diverse cues from different modalities for multimodal sentiment detection in the few-shot scenario. Specifically, we start by introducing a Consistently Distributed Sampling approach called CDS, which ensures that the few-shot dataset has the same category distribution as the full dataset. Unlike previous approaches primarily using prompts based on the text modality, we design unified multimodal prompts to reduce discrepancies between different modalities and dynamically incorporate multimodal demonstrations into the context of each multimodal instance. To enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a probabilistic fusion method to fuse output predictions from multiple diverse prompts for each input. Our extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. First, our method outperforms strong baselines in the multimodal few-shot setting. Furthermore, under the same amount of data (1% of the full dataset), our CDS-based experimental results significantly outperform those based on previously sampled datasets constructed from the same number of instances of each class.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 7 tables.

However, most previous works predominantly focus on text-based answers. While some studies address multimodal data, they still fall short in generating comprehensive multimodal answers, particularly for explaining concepts or providing step-by-step tutorials on how to accomplish specific goals. This capability is especially valuable for applications such as enterprise chatbots and settings such as customer service and educational systems, where the answers are sourced from multimodal data. In this paper, we introduce a simple and effective framework named MuRAR (Multimodal Retrieval and Answer Refinement). MuRAR enhances text-based answers by retrieving relevant multimodal data and refining the responses to create coherent multimodal answers. This framework can be easily extended to support multimodal answers in enterprise chatbots with minimal modifications. Human evaluation results indicate that multimodal answers generated by MuRAR are more useful and readable compared to plain text answers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Information Bottleneck: Learning Minimal Sufficient Unimodal and Multimodal Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.17444v3)** | 2022-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning effective joint embedding for cross-modal data has always been a focus in the field of multimodal machine learning. We argue that during multimodal fusion, the generated multimodal embedding may be redundant, and the discriminative unimodal information may be ignored, which often interferes with accurate prediction and leads to a higher risk of overfitting. Moreover, unimodal representations also contain noisy information that negatively influences the learning of cross-modal dynamics. To this end, we introduce the multimodal information bottleneck (MIB), aiming to learn a powerful and sufficient multimodal representation that is free of redundancy and to filter out noisy information in unimodal representations. Specifically, inheriting from the general information bottleneck (IB), MIB aims to learn the minimal sufficient representation for a given task by maximizing the mutual information between the representation and the target and simultaneously constraining the mutual information between the representation and the input data. Different from general IB, our MIB regularizes both the multimodal and unimodal representations, which is a comprehensive and flexible framework that is compatible with any fusion methods. We develop three MIB variants, namely, early-fusion MIB, late-fusion MIB, and complete MIB, to focus on different perspectives of information constraints.

| **[Multimodal Representation-disentangled Information Bottleneck for Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20225v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal data has significantly advanced recommendation systems by integrating diverse information sources to model user preferences and item characteristics. However, these systems often struggle with redundant and irrelevant information, which can degrade performance. Most existing methods either fuse multimodal information directly or use rigid architectural separation for disentanglement, failing to adequately filter noise and model the complex interplay between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Representation-disentangled Information Bottleneck (MRdIB). Concretely, we first employ a Multimodal Information Bottleneck to compress the input representations, effectively filtering out task-irrelevant noise while preserving rich semantic information. Then, we decompose the information based on its relationship with the recommendation target into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. We achieve this decomposition with a series of constraints: a unique information learning objective to preserve modality-unique signals, a redundant information learning objective to minimize overlap, and a synergistic information learning objective to capture emergent information. By optimizing these objectives, MRdIB guides a model to learn more powerful and disentangled representations. Extensive experiments on several competitive models and three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our MRdIB in enhancing multimodal recommendation.</p></details> |  |

Such capability is essential for applications such as sequential task planning and multi-source instruction summarization. While humans are capable of reasoning about and sequencing unordered multimodal procedural instructions, whether current machine learning models have such essential capability is still an open question. In this work, we benchmark models' capability of reasoning over and sequencing unordered multimodal instructions by curating datasets from popular online instructional manuals and collecting comprehensive human annotations. We find models not only perform significantly worse than humans but also seem incapable of efficiently utilizing the multimodal information. To improve machines' performance on multimodal event sequencing, we propose sequentiality-aware pretraining techniques that exploit the sequential alignment properties of both texts and images, resulting in > 5% significant improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the Conference of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2022</p></details> |
| **[Understanding and Measuring Robustness of Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12792v2)** | 2021-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modern digital world is increasingly becoming multimodal. Although multimodal learning has recently revolutionized the state-of-the-art performance in multimodal tasks, relatively little is known about the robustness of multimodal learning in an adversarial setting. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive measurement of the adversarial robustness of multimodal learning by focusing on the fusion of input modalities in multimodal models, via a framework called MUROAN (MUltimodal RObustness ANalyzer). We first present a unified view of multimodal models in MUROAN and identify the fusion mechanism of multimodal models as a key vulnerability. We then introduce a new type of multimodal adversarial attacks called decoupling attack in MUROAN that aims to compromise multimodal models by decoupling their fused modalities. We leverage the decoupling attack of MUROAN to measure several state-of-the-art multimodal models and find that the multimodal fusion mechanism in all these models is vulnerable to decoupling attacks. We especially demonstrate that, in the worst case, the decoupling attack of MUROAN achieves an attack success rate of 100% by decoupling just 1.16% of the input space. Finally, we show that traditional adversarial training is insufficient to improve the robustness of multimodal models with respect to decoupling attacks. We hope our findings encourage researchers to pursue improving the robustness of multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Factorized Multimodal Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06176v3)** | 2019-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning multimodal representations is a fundamentally complex research problem due to the presence of multiple heterogeneous sources of information. Although the presence of multiple modalities provides additional valuable information, there are two key challenges to address when learning from multimodal data: 1) models must learn the complex intra-modal and cross-modal interactions for prediction and 2) models must be robust to unexpected missing or noisy modalities during testing. In this paper, we propose to optimize for a joint generative-discriminative objective across multimodal data and labels. We introduce a model that factorizes representations into two sets of independent factors: multimodal discriminative and modality-specific generative factors. Multimodal discriminative factors are shared across all modalities and contain joint multimodal features required for discriminative tasks such as sentiment prediction. Modality-specific generative factors are unique for each modality and contain the information required for generating data. Experimental results show that our model is able to learn meaningful multimodal representations that achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on six multimodal datasets. Our model demonstrates flexible generative capabilities by conditioning on independent factors and can reconstruct missing modalities without significantly impacting performance. Lastly, we interpret our factorized representations to understand the interactions that influence multimodal learning.</p></details> | ICLR 2019 |

We also develop a dataset for the problem using an existing MKB. In an MKB, there are entities and their associated texts and images. In MET, given a text-image pair, one uses the information in the MKB to automatically identify the related entity in the text-image pair. We solve the task by using the information retrieval paradigm and implement several baselines using state-of-the-art methods in NLP and CV. We conduct extensive experiments and make analyses on the experimental results. The results show that the task is challenging, but current technologies can achieve relatively high performance. We will release the dataset, code, and models for future research.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Improving Multimodal Fusion with Hierarchical Mutual Information Maximization for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00412v2)** | 2021-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA), the performance of a model highly depends on the quality of synthesized embeddings. These embeddings are generated from the upstream process called multimodal fusion, which aims to extract and combine the input unimodal raw data to produce a richer multimodal representation. Previous work either back-propagates the task loss or manipulates the geometric property of feature spaces to produce favorable fusion results, which neglects the preservation of critical task-related information that flows from input to the fusion results. In this work, we propose a framework named MultiModal InfoMax (MMIM), which hierarchically maximizes the Mutual Information (MI) in unimodal input pairs (inter-modality) and between multimodal fusion result and unimodal input in order to maintain task-related information through multimodal fusion. The framework is jointly trained with the main task (MSA) to improve the performance of the downstream MSA task. To address the intractable issue of MI bounds, we further formulate a set of computationally simple parametric and non-parametric methods to approximate their truth value. Experimental results on the two widely used datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The implementation of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/declare-lab/Multimodal-Infomax.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a long paper at EMNLP 2021</p></details> |
| **[Implicit Multimodal Alignment: On the Generalization of Frozen LLMs to Multimodal Inputs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16700v2)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on multimodal tasks, without any multimodal finetuning. They are the building block for Large Multimodal Models, yet, we still lack a proper understanding of their success. In this work, we expose frozen LLMs to image, video, audio and text inputs and analyse their internal representation aiming to understand their generalization beyond textual inputs. Findings. Perceptual tokens (1) are easily distinguishable from textual ones inside LLMs, with significantly different representations, and complete translation to textual tokens does not exist. Yet, (2) both perceptual and textual tokens activate similar LLM weights. Despite being different, (3) perceptual and textual tokens are implicitly aligned inside LLMs, we call this the implicit multimodal alignment (IMA), and argue that this is linked to architectural design, helping LLMs to generalize. This provide more evidence to believe that the generalization of LLMs to multimodal inputs is mainly due to their architecture. Implications. (1) We find a positive correlation between the implicit alignment score and the task performance, suggesting that this could act as a proxy metric for model evaluation and selection. (2) A negative correlation exists regarding hallucinations, revealing that this problem is mainly due to misalignment between the internal perceptual and textual representations. (3) Perceptual tokens change slightly throughout the model, thus, we propose different approaches to skip computations (e.g. in FFN layers), and significantly reduce the inference cost. (4) Due to the slowly changing embeddings across layers, and the high overlap between textual and multimodal activated weights, we compress LLMs by keeping only 1 subnetwork that works well across a wide range of multimodal tasks.

| **[Multimodal Learning Without Labeled Multimodal Data: Guarantees and Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04539v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many machine learning systems that jointly learn from multiple modalities, a core research question is to understand the nature of multimodal interactions: how modalities combine to provide new task-relevant information that was not present in either alone. We study this challenge of interaction quantification in a semi-supervised setting with only labeled unimodal data and naturally co-occurring multimodal data (e.g., unlabeled images and captions, video and corresponding audio) but when labeling them is time-consuming. Using a precise information-theoretic definition of interactions, our key contribution is the derivation of lower and upper bounds to quantify the amount of multimodal interactions in this semi-supervised setting. We propose two lower bounds: one based on the shared information between modalities and the other based on disagreement between separately trained unimodal classifiers, and derive an upper bound through connections to approximate algorithms for min-entropy couplings. We validate these estimated bounds and show how they accurately track true interactions. Finally, we show how these theoretical results can be used to estimate multimodal model performance, guide data collection, and select appropriate multimodal models for various tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024, Code available at: https://github.com/pliang279/PID</p></details> |

In contrast, real-world applications often demand both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs for effective communication and grounded reasoning. Motivated by the recent success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), we adopt RL as a principled and effective paradigm to address the multi-step, outcome-driven challenges inherent in multimodal output generation. Here, we introduce M2IO-R1, a novel framework for Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) that supports both multimodal inputs and outputs. Central to our framework is an RL-based inserter, Inserter-R1-3B, trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization to guide image selection and placement in a controllable and semantically aligned manner. Empirical results show that our lightweight 3B inserter achieves strong reasoning capabilities with significantly reduced latency, outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Graph-Based Variational Mixture of Experts Network for Zero-Shot Multimodal Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15290v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal information extraction on social media is a series of fundamental tasks to construct the multimodal knowledge graph. The tasks aim to extract the structural information in free texts with the incorporate images, including: multimodal named entity typing and multimodal relation extraction. However, the growing number of multimodal data implies a growing category set and the newly emerged entity types or relations should be recognized without additional training. To address the aforementioned challenges, we focus on the zero-shot multimodal information extraction tasks which require using textual and visual modalities for recognizing unseen categories. Compared with text-based zero-shot information extraction models, the existing multimodal ones make the textual and visual modalities aligned directly and exploit various fusion strategies to improve their performances. But the existing methods ignore the fine-grained semantic correlation of text-image pairs and samples. Therefore, we propose the multimodal graph-based variational mixture of experts network (MG-VMoE) which takes the MoE network as the backbone and exploits it for aligning multimodal representations in a fine-grained way. Considering to learn informative representations of multimodal data, we design each expert network as a variational information bottleneck to process two modalities in a uni-backbone. Moreover, we also propose the multimodal graph-based virtual adversarial training to learn the semantic correlation between the samples. The experimental results on the two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of MG-VMoE over the baselines.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW 2025 |
| **[Multimodal learning with graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.03299v6)** | 2023-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence for graphs has achieved remarkable success in modeling complex systems, ranging from dynamic networks in biology to interacting particle systems in physics. However, the increasingly heterogeneous graph datasets call for multimodal methods that can combine different inductive biases: the set of assumptions that algorithms use to make predictions for inputs they have not encountered during training. Learning on multimodal datasets presents fundamental challenges because the inductive biases can vary by data modality and graphs might not be explicitly given in the input. To address these challenges, multimodal graph AI methods combine different modalities while leveraging cross-modal dependencies using graphs. Diverse datasets are combined using graphs and fed into sophisticated multimodal architectures, specified as image-intensive, knowledge-grounded and language-intensive models. Using this categorization, we introduce a blueprint for multimodal graph learning, use it to study existing methods and provide guidelines to design new models.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, 2 boxes</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Multimodal Knowledge Conflict for Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19509v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models(LMMs) face notable challenges when encountering multimodal knowledge conflicts, particularly under retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) frameworks where the contextual information from external sources may contradict the model's internal parametric knowledge, leading to unreliable outputs. However, existing benchmarks fail to reflect such realistic conflict scenarios. Most focus solely on intra-memory conflicts, while context-memory and inter-context conflicts remain largely investigated. Furthermore, commonly used factual knowledge-based evaluations are often overlooked, and existing datasets lack a thorough investigation into conflict detection capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose MMKC-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate factual knowledge conflicts in both context-memory and inter-context scenarios. MMKC-Bench encompasses three types of multimodal knowledge conflicts and includes 1,573 knowledge instances and 3,381 images across 23 broad types, collected through automated pipelines with human verification. We evaluate three representative series of LMMs on both model behavior analysis and conflict detection tasks. Our findings show that while current LMMs are capable of recognizing knowledge conflicts, they tend to favor internal parametric knowledge over external evidence. We hope MMKC-Bench will foster further research in multimodal knowledge conflict and enhance the development of multimodal RAG systems.

| **[On the Performance of Multimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03211v2)** | 2023-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot generalization capabilities across various downstream tasks. Recent research has introduced multimodal capabilities to LLMs by integrating independently pretrained vision encoders through model grafting. These multimodal variants undergo instruction tuning, similar to LLMs, enabling effective zero-shot generalization for multimodal tasks. This study conducts a comparative analysis of different multimodal instruction tuning approaches and evaluates their performance across a range of tasks, including complex reasoning, conversation, image captioning, multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and binary classification. Through rigorous benchmarking and ablation experiments, we reveal key insights for guiding architectural choices when incorporating multimodal capabilities into LLMs. However, current approaches have limitations; they do not sufficiently address the need for a diverse multimodal instruction dataset, which is crucial for enhancing task generalization. Additionally, they overlook issues related to truthfulness and factuality when generating responses. These findings illuminate current methodological constraints in adapting language models for image comprehension and provide valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness multimodal versions of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Situated Interactive MultiModal Conversations (SIMMC) as a new direction aimed at training agents that take multimodal actions grounded in a co-evolving multimodal input context in addition to the dialog history. We provide two SIMMC datasets totalling ~13K human-human dialogs (~169K utterances) using a multimodal Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) setup, on two shopping domains: (a) furniture (grounded in a shared virtual environment) and, (b) fashion (grounded in an evolving set of images). We also provide logs of the items appearing in each scene, and contextual NLU and coreference annotations, using a novel and unified framework of SIMMC conversational acts for both user and assistant utterances. Finally, we present several tasks within SIMMC as objective evaluation protocols, such as Structural API Prediction and Response Generation. We benchmark a collection of existing models on these SIMMC tasks as strong baselines, and demonstrate rich multimodal conversational interactions.

Previous works mainly focus on textual semantic coverage metrics such as ROUGE, which considers the visual content as supplemental data. Therefore, the summary is ineffective to cover the semantics of different modalities. This paper proposes a multi-task cross-modality learning framework (CISum) to improve multimodal semantic coverage by learning the cross-modality interaction in the multimodal article. To obtain the visual semantics, we translate images into visual descriptions based on the correlation with text content. Then, the visual description and text content are fused to generate the textual summary to capture the semantics of the multimodal content, and the most relevant image is selected as the visual summary. Furthermore, we design an automatic multimodal semantics coverage metric to evaluate the performance. Experimental results show that CISum outperforms baselines in multimodal semantics coverage metrics while maintaining the excellent performance of ROUGE and BLEU.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by SIAM SDM2023</p></details> |

This approach has shown promising results by utilizing modern deep learning architectures. Despite the achievements made, challenges remain in data representation, alignment techniques, reasoning, generation, and quantification within multimodal learning. Additionally, assumptions about the dominant role of textual modality in decision-making have been made. However, limited investigations have been conducted on the influence of different modalities in Multimodal Machine Learning systems. This paper aims to address this gap by studying the impact of each modality on multimodal learning tasks. The research focuses on verifying presumptions and gaining insights into the usage of different modalities. The main contribution of this work is the proposal of a methodology to determine the effect of each modality on several Multimodal Machine Learning models and datasets from various tasks. Specifically, the study examines Multimodal Sentiment Analysis, Multimodal Emotion Recognition, Multimodal Hate Speech Recognition, and Multimodal Disease Detection. The study objectives include training SOTA MultiModal Machine Learning models with masked modalities to evaluate their impact on performance. Furthermore, the research aims to identify the most influential modality or set of modalities for each task and draw conclusions for diverse multimodal classification tasks. By undertaking these investigations, this research contributes to a better understanding of the role of individual modalities in multi-modal learning and provides valuable insights for future advancements in this field.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[MultiDelete for Multimodal Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.12047v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning removes specific knowledge about training data samples from an already trained model. It has significant practical benefits, such as purging private, inaccurate, or outdated information from trained models without the need for complete re-training. Unlearning within a multimodal setting presents unique challenges due to the complex dependencies between different data modalities and the expensive cost of training on large multimodal datasets and architectures. This paper presents the first machine unlearning approach for multimodal data and models, titled MultiDelete, which is designed to decouple associations between unimodal data points during unlearning without losing the overall representation strength of the trained model. MultiDelete advocates for three key properties for effective multimodal unlearning: (a): modality decoupling, which effectively decouples the association between individual unimodal data points marked for deletion, rendering them as unrelated data points, (b): multimodal knowledge retention, which retains the multimodal representation post-unlearning, and (c): unimodal knowledge retention, which retains the unimodal representation postunlearning. MultiDelete is efficient to train and is not constrained by using a strongly convex loss -- a common restriction among existing baselines. Experiments on two architectures and four datasets, including image-text and graph-text datasets, show that MultiDelete gains an average improvement of 17.6 points over best performing baseline in unlearning multimodal samples, can maintain the multimodal and unimodal knowledge of the original model post unlearning, and can provide better protection to unlearned data against adversarial attacks.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

Their design and capacity to perform any-to-any conditional and unconditional generation make them appealing. However, different variants of multimodal VAEs often suffer from generating low-quality output, particularly when complex modalities such as images are involved. In addition to that, they frequently exhibit low coherence among the generated modalities when sampling from the joint distribution. To address these limitations, we propose a new variant of the multimodal VAE ELBO that incorporates a better decoder using a diffusion generative model. The diffusion decoder enables the model to learn complex modalities and generate high-quality outputs. The multimodal model can also seamlessly integrate with a standard feed-forward decoder for different types of modality, facilitating end-to-end training and inference. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary score-based model to enhance the unconditional generation capabilities of our proposed approach. This approach addresses the limitations imposed by conventional multimodal VAEs and opens up new possibilities to improve multimodal generation tasks. Our model provides state-of-the-art results compared to other multimodal VAEs in different datasets with higher coherence and superior quality in the generated modalities.</p></details> |  |

EMMA: An Enhanced MultiModal ReAsoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05444v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to organically reason over and with both text and images is a pillar of human intelligence, yet the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform such multimodal reasoning remains under-explored. Existing benchmarks often emphasize text-dominant reasoning or rely on shallow visual cues, failing to adequately assess integrated visual and textual reasoning. We introduce EMMA (Enhanced MultiModal reAsoning), a benchmark targeting organic multimodal reasoning across mathematics, physics, chemistry, and coding. EMMA tasks demand advanced cross-modal reasoning that cannot be addressed by reasoning independently in each modality, offering an enhanced test suite for MLLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on EMMA reveals significant limitations in handling complex multimodal and multi-step reasoning tasks, even with advanced techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time compute scaling underperforming. These findings underscore the need for improved multimodal architectures and training paradigms to close the gap between human and model reasoning in multimodality.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we are concerned with understanding how models behave as the type of modalities differ between training and deployment, a situation that naturally arises in many applications of multimodal learning to hardware platforms. We present a multimodal robustness framework to provide a systematic analysis of common multimodal representation learning methods. Further, we identify robustness short-comings of these approaches and propose two intervention techniques leading to $1.5\times$-$4\times$ robustness improvements on three datasets, AudioSet, Kinetics-400 and ImageNet-Captions. Finally, we demonstrate that these interventions better utilize additional modalities, if present, to achieve competitive results of $44.2$ mAP on AudioSet 20K.</p></details> |  |
| **[What to align in multimodal contrastive learning?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07402v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans perceive the world through multisensory integration, blending the information of different modalities to adapt their behavior. Contrastive learning offers an appealing solution for multimodal self-supervised learning. Indeed, by considering each modality as a different view of the same entity, it learns to align features of different modalities in a shared representation space. However, this approach is intrinsically limited as it only learns shared or redundant information between modalities, while multimodal interactions can arise in other ways. In this work, we introduce CoMM, a Contrastive MultiModal learning strategy that enables the communication between modalities in a single multimodal space. Instead of imposing cross- or intra- modality constraints, we propose to align multimodal representations by maximizing the mutual information between augmented versions of these multimodal features. Our theoretical analysis shows that shared, synergistic and unique terms of information naturally emerge from this formulation, allowing us to estimate multimodal interactions beyond redundancy. We test CoMM both in a controlled and in a series of real-world settings: in the former, we demonstrate that CoMM effectively captures redundant, unique and synergistic information between modalities. In the latter, CoMM learns complex multimodal interactions and achieves state-of-the-art results on the seven multimodal benchmarks.

Medical diagnostics, in particular, often hinge on human interpretation of multi-modal information. In order for artificial intelligence to make progress in automated, objective, and accurate diagnosis and prognosis, methods to fuse information from multiple medical imaging modalities are required. However, combining information from multiple data sources has several challenges, as current deep learning architectures lack the ability to extract useful representations from multimodal information, and often simple concatenation is used to fuse such information. In this work, we propose Multimodal DenseNet, a novel architecture for fusing multimodal data. Instead of focusing on concatenation or early and late fusion, our proposed architectures fuses information over several layers and gives the model flexibility in how it combines information from multiple sources. We apply this architecture to the challenge of polyp characterization and landmark identification in endoscopy. Features from white light images are fused with features from narrow band imaging or depth maps. This study demonstrates that Multimodal DenseNet outperforms monomodal classification as well as other multimodal fusion techniques by a significant margin on two different datasets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Existing methods manifest limitations in leveraging nonverbal information for discerning complex semantics in unsupervised scenarios. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised multimodal clustering method (UMC), making a pioneering contribution to this field. UMC introduces a unique approach to constructing augmentation views for multimodal data, which are then used to perform pre-training to establish well-initialized representations for subsequent clustering. An innovative strategy is proposed to dynamically select high-quality samples as guidance for representation learning, gauged by the density of each sample's nearest neighbors. Besides, it is equipped to automatically determine the optimal value for the top-$K$ parameter in each cluster to refine sample selection. Finally, both high- and low-quality samples are used to learn representations conducive to effective clustering. We build baselines on benchmark multimodal intent and dialogue act datasets. UMC shows remarkable improvements of 2-6\% scores in clustering metrics over state-of-the-art methods, marking the first successful endeavor in this domain.

| **[CofiPara: A Coarse-to-fine Paradigm for Multimodal Sarcasm Target Identification with Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00390v2)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media abounds with multimodal sarcasm, and identifying sarcasm targets is particularly challenging due to the implicit incongruity not directly evident in the text and image modalities. Current methods for Multimodal Sarcasm Target Identification (MSTI) predominantly focus on superficial indicators in an end-to-end manner, overlooking the nuanced understanding of multimodal sarcasm conveyed through both the text and image. This paper proposes a versatile MSTI framework with a coarse-to-fine paradigm, by augmenting sarcasm explainability with reasoning and pre-training knowledge. Inspired by the powerful capacity of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on multimodal reasoning, we first engage LMMs to generate competing rationales for coarser-grained pre-training of a small language model on multimodal sarcasm detection. We then propose fine-tuning the model for finer-grained sarcasm target identification. Our framework is thus empowered to adeptly unveil the intricate targets within multimodal sarcasm and mitigate the negative impact posed by potential noise inherently in LMMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our model far outperforms state-of-the-art MSTI methods, and markedly exhibits explainability in deciphering sarcasm as well.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |

However, multimodal Transformers significantly suffer from a quadratic complexity of the multi-head attention with the input sequence length, especially as the number of modalities increases. To address this, we introduce Low-Cost Multimodal Transformer (LoCoMT), a novel multimodal attention mechanism that aims to reduce computational cost during training and inference with minimal performance loss. Specifically, by assigning different multimodal attention patterns to each attention head, LoCoMT can flexibly control multimodal signals and theoretically ensures a reduced computational cost compared to existing multimodal Transformer variants. Experimental results on two multimodal datasets, namely Audioset and MedVidCL demonstrate that LoCoMT not only reduces GFLOPs but also matches or even outperforms established models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2024 (5 pages)</p></details> |

Traditionally confined to scenarios with solely numerical input features, conformal prediction is now extended to multimodal contexts through our methodology, which harnesses internal features from complex neural network architectures processing images and unstructured text. Our findings highlight the potential for internal neural network features, extracted from convergence points where multimodal information is combined, to be used by conformal prediction to construct prediction intervals (PIs). This capability paves new paths for deploying conformal prediction in domains abundant with multimodal data, enabling a broader range of problems to benefit from guaranteed distribution-free uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | 20 pages, 34 figures |
| **[VLMT: Vision-Language Multimodal Transformer for Multimodal Multi-hop Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08269v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing availability of multimodal data across text, tables, and images presents new challenges for developing models capable of complex cross-modal reasoning. Existing methods for Multimodal Multi-hop Question Answering (MMQA) often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities, reliance on modality conversion, and inadequate alignment between visual and textual representations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Vision-Language Multimodal Transformer (VLMT), a unified architecture that integrates a transformer-based vision encoder with a sequence-to-sequence language model. VLMT employs a direct token-level injection mechanism to fuse visual and textual inputs within a shared embedding space, eliminating the need for intermediate projection layers. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reasoning, a three-stage pretraining strategy is proposed to progressively align vision-language representations and improve the model's capacity for multimodal understanding. Based on the pretrained backbone, two task-specific modules are instantiated to form a two-stage MMQA framework: a multimodal reranker that predicts document relevance scores and utilizes a relative threshold with top-k strategy for context retrieval, and a multimodal question answering model that generates contextually grounded answers based on the retrieved evidence. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. On MultimodalQA validation set, VLMT-Large achieves 76.5% Exact Match and 80.1% F1, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by +9.1% in Exact Match and +8.8% in F1. On WebQA, it attains a QA score of 47.6, surpassing prior models such as PERQA by +3.2. These results highlight VLMT's strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and its potential to advance real-world information retrieval and question answering systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MM-BigBench: Evaluating Multimodal Models on Multimodal Content Comprehension Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09036v1)** | 2023-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The popularity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has triggered a recent surge in research efforts dedicated to evaluating these models. Nevertheless, existing evaluation studies of MLLMs primarily focus on the comprehension and reasoning of unimodal (vision) content, neglecting performance evaluations in the domain of multimodal (vision-language) content understanding. Beyond multimodal reasoning, tasks related to multimodal content comprehension necessitate a profound understanding of multimodal contexts, achieved through the multimodal interaction to obtain a final answer. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive assessment framework called MM-BigBench, which incorporates a diverse range of metrics to offer an extensive evaluation of the performance of various models and instructions across a wide spectrum of diverse multimodal content comprehension tasks. Consequently, our work complements research on the performance of MLLMs in multimodal comprehension tasks, achieving a more comprehensive and holistic evaluation of MLLMs. To begin, we employ the Best Performance metric to ascertain each model's performance upper bound on different datasets. Subsequently, the Mean Relative Gain metric offers an assessment of the overall performance of various models and instructions, while the Stability metric measures their sensitivity. Furthermore, previous research centers on evaluating models independently or solely assessing instructions, neglecting the adaptability between models and instructions. We propose the Adaptability metric to quantify the adaptability between models and instructions. Our paper evaluates a total of 20 language models (14 MLLMs) on 14 multimodal datasets spanning 6 tasks, with 10 instructions for each task, and derives novel insights. Our code will be released at https://github.com/declare-lab/MM-BigBench.</p></details> | Underview |
| **[Extracting Multimodal Learngene in CLIP: Unveiling the Multimodal Generalizable Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16673v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) has attracted widespread attention for its multimodal generalizable knowledge, which is significant for downstream tasks. However, the computational overhead of a large number of parameters and large-scale pre-training poses challenges of pre-training a different scale of CLIP. Learngene extracts the generalizable components termed as learngene from an ancestry model and initializes diverse descendant models with it. Previous Learngene paradigms fail to handle the generalizable knowledge in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we put forward the idea of utilizing a multimodal block to extract the multimodal generalizable knowledge, which inspires us to propose MM-LG (Multimodal Learngene), a novel framework designed to extract and leverage generalizable components from CLIP. Specifically, we first establish multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract the multimodal and unimodal generalizable knowledge in a weighted-sum manner. Subsequently, we employ these components to numerically initialize descendant models of varying scales and modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate MM-LG's effectiveness, which achieves performance gains over existing learngene approaches (e.g.,+3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +4.13% on Flickr30k) and comparable or superior results to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm (e.g.,+1.9% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +3.65% on Flickr30k). Notably, MM-LG requires only around 25% of the parameter storage while reducing around 2.8 times pre-training costs for diverse model scales compared to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, making it particularly suitable for efficient deployment across diverse downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Classification and Out-of-distribution Detection for Multimodal Intent Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12453v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal intent understanding is a significant research area that requires effective leveraging of multiple modalities to analyze human language. Existing methods face two main challenges in this domain. Firstly, they have limitations in capturing the nuanced and high-level semantics underlying complex in-distribution (ID) multimodal intents. Secondly, they exhibit poor generalization when confronted with unseen out-of-distribution (OOD) data in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for both ID classification and OOD detection (MIntOOD). We first introduce a weighted feature fusion network that models multimodal representations. This network dynamically learns the importance of each modality, adapting to multimodal contexts. To develop discriminative representations for both tasks, we synthesize pseudo-OOD data from convex combinations of ID data and engage in multimodal representation learning from both coarse-grained and fine-grained perspectives. The coarse-grained perspective focuses on distinguishing between ID and OOD binary classes, while the fine-grained perspective not only enhances the discrimination between different ID classes but also captures instance-level interactions between ID and OOD samples, promoting proximity among similar instances and separation from dissimilar ones. We establish baselines for three multimodal intent datasets and build an OOD benchmark. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves OOD detection performance with a 3~10% increase in AUROC scores while achieving new state-of-the-art results in ID classification. Data and codes are available at https://github.com/thuiar/MIntOOD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> |

Previous work has attempted to adopt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to realize UMR using only text data. However, our preliminary experiments demonstrate that more diverse multimodal training data can further unlock the potential of MLLMs. Despite its effectiveness, the existing multimodal training data is highly imbalanced in terms of modality, which motivates us to develop a training data synthesis pipeline and construct a large-scale, high-quality fused-modal training dataset. Based on the synthetic training data, we develop the General Multimodal Embedder (GME), an MLLM-based dense retriever designed for UMR. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive UMR Benchmark (UMRB) to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing UMR methods. Last, we provide in-depth analyses of model scaling and training strategies, and perform ablation studies on both the model and synthetic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025, models at https://huggingface.co/Alibaba-NLP/gme-Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct</p></details> |
| **[MMoE: Enhancing Multimodal Models with Mixtures of Multimodal Interaction Experts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09580v3)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in multimodal models have greatly improved how interactions relevant to various tasks are modeled. Today's multimodal models mainly focus on the correspondence between images and text, using this for tasks like image-text matching. However, this covers only a subset of real-world interactions. Novel interactions, such as sarcasm expressed through opposing spoken words and gestures or humor expressed through utterances and tone of voice, remain challenging. In this paper, we introduce an approach to enhance multimodal models, which we call Multimodal Mixtures of Experts (MMoE). The key idea in MMoE is to train separate expert models for each type of multimodal interaction, such as redundancy present in both modalities, uniqueness in one modality, or synergy that emerges when both modalities are fused. On a sarcasm detection task (MUStARD) and a humor detection task (URFUNNY), we obtain new state-of-the-art results. MMoE is also able to be applied to various types of models to gain improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[A survey of multimodal deep generative models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.02127v1)** | 2022-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning is a framework for building models that make predictions based on different types of modalities. Important challenges in multimodal learning are the inference of shared representations from arbitrary modalities and cross-modal generation via these representations; however, achieving this requires taking the heterogeneous nature of multimodal data into account. In recent years, deep generative models, i.e., generative models in which distributions are parameterized by deep neural networks, have attracted much attention, especially variational autoencoders, which are suitable for accomplishing the above challenges because they can consider heterogeneity and infer good representations of data. Therefore, various multimodal generative models based on variational autoencoders, called multimodal deep generative models, have been proposed in recent years. In this paper, we provide a categorized survey of studies on multimodal deep generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Advanced Robotics</p></details> |

Multimodal DTM constitutes an extension of the dynamic timetable model (DTM), developed originally for unimodal journey planning. Multimodal DTM exhibits a very fast query algorithm, meeting the request for real-time response to best journey queries and an extremely fast update algorithm for updating the timetable information in case of delays. In particular, an experimental study on real-world metropolitan networks demonstrates that our methods compare favorably with other state-of-the-art approaches when public transport along with unrestricted w.r.t. departing time traveling (walking and electric vehicles) is considered.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Task Vectors Enable Many-Shot Multimodal In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15334v3)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success of interleaved Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in few-shot learning suggests that in-context learning (ICL) with many examples can be promising for learning new tasks. However, this many-shot multimodal ICL setting has one crucial problem: it is fundamentally limited by the model's context length set at pretraining. The problem is especially prominent in the multimodal domain, which processes both text and images, requiring additional tokens. This motivates the need for a multimodal method to compress many shots into fewer tokens without finetuning. In this work, we enable LMMs to perform multimodal, many-shot in-context learning by leveraging Multimodal Task Vectors (MTV) -- compact implicit representations of in-context examples compressed in the model's attention heads. Specifically, we first demonstrate the existence of such MTV in LMMs and then leverage these extracted MTV to enable many-shot in-context learning for various vision-and-language tasks. Our experiments suggest that MTV can scale in performance with the number of compressed shots and generalize to similar out-of-domain tasks without additional context length for inference.

Previous studies in multimedia and psychology attribute the effectiveness of lecture presentations to their multimodal nature. As a step toward developing AI to aid in student learning as intelligent teacher assistants, we introduce the Multimodal Lecture Presentations dataset as a large-scale benchmark testing the capabilities of machine learning models in multimodal understanding of educational content. Our dataset contains aligned slides and spoken language, for 180+ hours of video and 9000+ slides, with 10 lecturers from various subjects (e.g., computer science, dentistry, biology). We introduce two research tasks which are designed as stepping stones towards AI agents that can explain (automatically captioning a lecture presentation) and illustrate (synthesizing visual figures to accompany spoken explanations) educational content. We provide manual annotations to help implement these two research tasks and evaluate state-of-the-art models on them. Comparing baselines and human student performances, we find that current models struggle in (1) weak crossmodal alignment between slides and spoken text, (2) learning novel visual mediums, (3) technical language, and (4) long-range sequences. Towards addressing this issue, we also introduce PolyViLT, a multimodal transformer trained with a multi-instance learning loss that is more effective than current approaches. We conclude by shedding light on the challenges and opportunities in multimodal understanding of educational presentations.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR): A New Benchmark for Multimodal Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16033v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly trained and tested on consistent visual-textual inputs, leaving open the question of whether they can handle inconsistencies in real-world, layout-rich content. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR) benchmark to assess MLLMs' ability to detect and reason about semantic mismatches in artifacts such as webpages, presentation slides, and posters. MMIR comprises 534 challenging samples, each containing synthetically injected errors across five reasoning-heavy categories: Factual Contradiction, Identity Misattribution, Contextual Mismatch, Quantitative Discrepancy, and Temporal/Spatial Incoherence. We evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs, showing that models with dedicated multimodal reasoning capabilities, such as o1, substantially outperform their counterparts while open-source models remain particularly vulnerable to inconsistency errors. Detailed error analyses further show that models excel in detecting pairwise inconsistencies but struggle with inconsistencies confined to single elements in complex layouts. Probing experiments reveal that single-modality prompting, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Set-of-Mark (SoM) methods, yields marginal gains, revealing a key bottleneck in cross-modal reasoning. Our findings highlight the need for advanced multimodal reasoning and point to future research on multimodal inconsistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[MINT: Multimodal Instruction Tuning with Multimodal Interaction Grouping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02308v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal foundation models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a range of tasks. These breakthroughs are largely driven by new pre-training paradigms that leverage large-scale, unlabeled multimodal data, followed by instruction fine-tuning on curated labeled datasets and high-quality prompts. While there is growing interest in scaling instruction fine-tuning to ever-larger datasets in both quantity and scale, our findings reveal that simply increasing the number of instruction-tuning tasks does not consistently yield better performance. Instead, we observe that grouping tasks by the common interactions across modalities, such as discovering redundant shared information, prioritizing modality selection with unique information, or requiring synergistic fusion to discover new information from both modalities, encourages the models to learn transferrable skills within a group while suppressing interference from mismatched tasks. To this end, we introduce MINT, a simple yet surprisingly effective task-grouping strategy based on the type of multimodal interaction. We demonstrate that the proposed method greatly outperforms existing task grouping baselines for multimodal instruction tuning, striking an effective balance between generalization and specialization.</p></details> |  |

However, its generalization ability in complex task distributions, such as multimodal tasks, has not been thoroughly studied. Recently, some studies on multimodality-based meta-learning have emerged. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the multimodality-based meta-learning landscape in terms of the methodologies and applications. We first formalize the definition of meta-learning in multimodality, along with the research challenges in this growing field, such as how to enrich the input in few-shot learning (FSL) or zero-shot learning (ZSL) in multimodal scenarios and how to generalize the models to new tasks. We then propose a new taxonomy to discuss typical meta-learning algorithms in multimodal tasks systematically. We investigate the contributions of related papers and summarize them by our taxonomy.

Existing UniMs are designed to simultaneously learn both multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, demanding substantial computational resources, and often struggle to generate interleaved text-image. We present ARMOR, a resource-efficient and pure autoregressive framework that achieves both understanding and generation by fine-tuning existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, ARMOR extends existing MLLMs from three perspectives: (1) For model architecture, an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with a forward-switching mechanism is introduced to unify embedding space integrating textual and visual modalities for enabling natural text-image interleaved generation with minimal computational overhead. (2) For training data, a meticulously curated, high-quality interleaved dataset is collected for fine-tuning MLLMs. (3) For the training algorithm, we propose a ``what or how to generate'' algorithm to empower existing MLLMs with multimodal generation capabilities while preserving their multimodal understanding capabilities, through three progressive training stages based on the collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ARMOR upgrades existing MLLMs to UniMs with promising image generation capabilities, using limited training resources.

In the Federated Learning algorithm, the clients submit a locally trained model, and the server aggregates these parameters until convergence. Despite significant efforts that have been made to FL in fields like computer vision, audio, and natural language processing, the FL applications utilizing multimodal data streams remain largely unexplored. It is known that multimodal learning has broad real-world applications in emotion recognition, healthcare, multimedia, and social media, while user privacy persists as a critical concern. Specifically, there are no existing FL benchmarks targeting multimodal applications or related tasks. In order to facilitate the research in multimodal FL, we introduce FedMultimodal, the first FL benchmark for multimodal learning covering five representative multimodal applications from ten commonly used datasets with a total of eight unique modalities. FedMultimodal offers a systematic FL pipeline, enabling end-to-end modeling framework ranging from data partition and feature extraction to FL benchmark algorithms and model evaluation. Unlike existing FL benchmarks, FedMultimodal provides a standardized approach to assess the robustness of FL against three common data corruptions in real-life multimodal applications: missing modalities, missing labels, and erroneous labels. We hope that FedMultimodal can accelerate numerous future research directions, including designing multimodal FL algorithms toward extreme data heterogeneity, robustness multimodal FL, and efficient multimodal FL.

In this perspective multimodality and adaptivity represent focal issues, enabling users to communicate more freely and naturally with automated systems. One of the basic problem of multimodal interaction is the fusion process. Current approaches to fusion are mainly two: the former implements the multimodal fusion at dialogue management level, whereas the latter at grammar level. In this paper, we propose a multimodal attribute grammar, that provides constructions both for representing input symbols from different modalities and for modeling semantic and temporal features of multimodal input symbols, enabling the specification of multimodal languages. Moreover, an application of the proposed approach in the context of a multimodal language specification to control a driver assistance system, as robots using different integrated interaction modalities, is given.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Despite the longstanding consideration of this perspective in philosophy and cognitive science, the study of multimodality remains relatively under-explored within the field of machine learning. Nevertheless, current studies of multimodal machine learning are limited to empirical practices, lacking theoretical foundations beyond heuristic arguments. An intriguing finding from the practice of multimodal learning is that a model trained on multiple modalities can outperform a finely-tuned unimodal model, even on unimodal tasks. This paper provides a theoretical framework that explains this phenomenon, by studying generalization properties of multimodal learning algorithms. We demonstrate that multimodal learning allows for a superior generalization bound compared to unimodal learning, up to a factor of $O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ represents the sample size. Such advantage occurs when both connection and heterogeneity exist between the modalities.</p></details> | Added reference |

DreamLLM operates on two fundamental principles. The first focuses on the generative modeling of both language and image posteriors by direct sampling in the raw multimodal space. This approach circumvents the limitations and information loss inherent to external feature extractors like CLIP, and a more thorough multimodal understanding is obtained. Second, DreamLLM fosters the generation of raw, interleaved documents, modeling both text and image contents, along with unstructured layouts. This allows DreamLLM to learn all conditional, marginal, and joint multimodal distributions effectively. As a result, DreamLLM is the first MLLM capable of generating free-form interleaved content. Comprehensive experiments highlight DreamLLM's superior performance as a zero-shot multimodal generalist, reaping from the enhanced learning synergy.

To build effective multimodal interfaces, automated interpretation of user multimodal inputs is important. Inspired by the previous investigation on cognitive status in multimodal human machine interaction, we have developed a greedy algorithm for interpreting user referring expressions (i.e., multimodal reference resolution). This algorithm incorporates the cognitive principles of Conversational Implicature and Givenness Hierarchy and applies constraints from various sources (e.g., temporal, semantic, and contextual) to resolve references. Our empirical results have shown the advantage of this algorithm in efficiently resolving a variety of user references. Because of its simplicity and generality, this approach has the potential to improve the robustness of multimodal input interpretation.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Evolution of Multimodal Model Architectures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17927v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work uniquely identifies and characterizes four prevalent multimodal model architectural patterns in the contemporary multimodal landscape. Systematically categorizing models by architecture type facilitates monitoring of developments in the multimodal domain. Distinct from recent survey papers that present general information on multimodal architectures, this research conducts a comprehensive exploration of architectural details and identifies four specific architectural types. The types are distinguished by their respective methodologies for integrating multimodal inputs into the deep neural network model. The first two types (Type A and B) deeply fuses multimodal inputs within the internal layers of the model, whereas the following two types (Type C and D) facilitate early fusion at the input stage. Type-A employs standard cross-attention, whereas Type-B utilizes custom-designed layers for modality fusion within the internal layers. On the other hand, Type-C utilizes modality-specific encoders, while Type-D leverages tokenizers to process the modalities at the model's input stage. The identified architecture types aid the monitoring of any-to-any multimodal model development. Notably, Type-C and Type-D are currently favored in the construction of any-to-any multimodal models. Type-C, distinguished by its non-tokenizing multimodal model architecture, is emerging as a viable alternative to Type-D, which utilizes input-tokenizing techniques. To assist in model selection, this work highlights the advantages and disadvantages of each architecture type based on data and compute requirements, architecture complexity, scalability, simplification of adding modalities, training objectives, and any-to-any multimodal generation capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 6 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

Despite its potential to advance diverse research fields like social networks and e-commerce, MAG representation learning (MAGRL) remains underexplored due to the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation frameworks. In this paper, we first propose MAGB, a comprehensive MAG benchmark dataset, featuring curated graphs from various domains with both textual and visual attributes. Based on MAGB dataset, we further systematically evaluate two mainstream MAGRL paradigms: $\textit{GNN-as-Predictor}$, which integrates multimodal attributes via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and $\textit{VLM-as-Predictor}$, which harnesses Vision Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot reasoning. Extensive experiments on MAGB reveal following critical insights: $\textit{(i)}$ Modality significances fluctuate drastically with specific domain characteristics. $\textit{(ii)}$ Multimodal embeddings can elevate the performance ceiling of GNNs. However, intrinsic biases among modalities may impede effective training, particularly in low-data scenarios. $\textit{(iii)}$ VLMs are highly effective at generating multimodal embeddings that alleviate the imbalance between textual and visual attributes. These discoveries, which illuminate the synergy between multimodal attributes and graph topologies, contribute to reliable benchmarks, paving the way for future MAG research. The MAGB dataset and evaluation pipeline are publicly available at https://github.com/sktsherlock/MAGB.</p></details> |  |

| **[Calibrating Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01265v1)** | 2023-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has achieved remarkable progress in a wide range of scenarios. However, the reliability of multimodal learning remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive empirical studies, we identify current multimodal classification methods suffer from unreliable predictive confidence that tend to rely on partial modalities when estimating confidence. Specifically, we find that the confidence estimated by current models could even increase when some modalities are corrupted. To address the issue, we introduce an intuitive principle for multimodal learning, i.e., the confidence should not increase when one modality is removed. Accordingly, we propose a novel regularization technique, i.e., Calibrating Multimodal Learning (CML) regularization, to calibrate the predictive confidence of previous methods. This technique could be flexibly equipped by existing models and improve the performance in terms of confidence calibration, classification accuracy, and model robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, current MLLMs still face challenges in effectively integrating knowledge across these modalities during multimodal knowledge reasoning, leading to inconsistencies in reasoning outcomes. To systematically explore this issue, we propose four evaluation tasks and construct a new dataset. We conduct a series of experiments on this dataset to analyze and compare the extent of consistency degradation in multimodal knowledge reasoning within MLLMs. Based on the experimental results, we identify factors contributing to the observed degradation in consistency. Our research provides new insights into the challenges of multimodal knowledge reasoning and offers valuable guidance for future efforts aimed at improving MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Conventional studies typically require massive labeled data to train models for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA). However, collecting and annotating fine-grained multimodal data for MABSA is tough. To alleviate the above issue, we perform three MABSA-related tasks with quite a small number of labeled multimodal samples. We first build diverse and comprehensive multimodal few-shot datasets according to the data distribution. To capture the specific prompt for each aspect term in a few-shot scenario, we propose a novel Generative Multimodal Prompt (GMP) model for MABSA, which includes the Multimodal Encoder module and the N-Stream Decoders module. We further introduce a subtask to predict the number of aspect terms in each instance to construct the multimodal prompt. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines on two MABSA-related tasks in the few-shot setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables, ACL 2023 Long Paper (Findings)</p></details> |

However, existing approaches face difficulties adequately capturing the intrinsic connections between the modalities and overlooking the corresponding semantic representations of intent. To address these limitations, we present the Anchor-based Multimodal Embedding with Semantic Synchronization (A-MESS) framework. We first design an Anchor-based Multimodal Embedding (A-ME) module that employs an anchor-based embedding fusion mechanism to integrate multimodal inputs. Furthermore, we develop a Semantic Synchronization (SS) strategy with the Triplet Contrastive Learning pipeline, which optimizes the process by synchronizing multimodal representation with label descriptions produced by the large language model. Comprehensive experiments indicate that our A-MESS achieves state-of-the-art and provides substantial insight into multimodal representation and downstream tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 |
| **[Frequency Spectrum is More Effective for Multimodal Representation and Fusion: A Multimodal Spectrum Rumor Detector](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11023v1)** | 2023-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal content, such as mixing text with images, presents significant challenges to rumor detection in social media. Existing multimodal rumor detection has focused on mixing tokens among spatial and sequential locations for unimodal representation or fusing clues of rumor veracity across modalities. However, they suffer from less discriminative unimodal representation and are vulnerable to intricate location dependencies in the time-consuming fusion of spatial and sequential tokens. This work makes the first attempt at multimodal rumor detection in the frequency domain, which efficiently transforms spatial features into the frequency spectrum and obtains highly discriminative spectrum features for multimodal representation and fusion. A novel Frequency Spectrum Representation and fUsion network (FSRU) with dual contrastive learning reveals the frequency spectrum is more effective for multimodal representation and fusion, extracting the informative components for rumor detection. FSRU involves three novel mechanisms: utilizing the Fourier transform to convert features in the spatial domain to the frequency domain, the unimodal spectrum compression, and the cross-modal spectrum co-selection module in the frequency domain. Substantial experiments show that FSRU achieves satisfactory multimodal rumor detection performance.</p></details> | 12 pages, AAAI-2024 |
| **[Self-Supervised Multimodal Learning: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01008v3)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning, which aims to understand and analyze information from multiple modalities, has achieved substantial progress in the supervised regime in recent years. However, the heavy dependence on data paired with expensive human annotations impedes scaling up models. Meanwhile, given the availability of large-scale unannotated data in the wild, self-supervised learning has become an attractive strategy to alleviate the annotation bottleneck. Building on these two directions, self-supervised multimodal learning (SSML) provides ways to learn from raw multimodal data. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in SSML, in which we elucidate three major challenges intrinsic to self-supervised learning with multimodal data: (1) learning representations from multimodal data without labels, (2) fusion of different modalities, and (3) learning with unaligned data. We then detail existing solutions to these challenges. Specifically, we consider (1) objectives for learning from multimodal unlabeled data via self-supervision, (2) model architectures from the perspective of different multimodal fusion strategies, and (3) pair-free learning strategies for coarse-grained and fine-grained alignment. We also review real-world applications of SSML algorithms in diverse fields such as healthcare, remote sensing, and machine translation. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions for SSML.

| **[Sparsely Multimodal Data Fusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.20280v2)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal data fusion is essential for applications requiring the integration of diverse data sources, especially in the presence of incomplete or sparsely available modalities. This paper presents a comparative study of three multimodal embedding techniques, Modal Channel Attention (MCA), Zorro, and Everything at Once (EAO), to evaluate their performance on sparsely multimodal data. MCA introduces fusion embeddings for all combinations of input modalities and uses attention masking to create distinct attention channels, enabling flexible and efficient data fusion. Experiments on two datasets with four modalities each, CMU-MOSEI and TCGA, demonstrate that MCA outperforms Zorro across ranking, recall, regression, and classification tasks and outperforms EAO across regression and classification tasks. MCA achieves superior performance by maintaining robust uniformity across unimodal and fusion embeddings. While EAO performs best in ranking metrics due to its approach of forming fusion embeddings post-inference, it underperforms in downstream tasks requiring multimodal interactions. These results highlight the importance of contrasting all modality combinations in constructing embedding spaces and offers insights into the design of multimodal architectures for real-world applications with incomplete data.</p></details> |  |

The present document is intended to support the discussion on multimodal content representation, its possible objectives and basic constraints, and how the definition of a generic representation framework for multimodal content representation may be approached. It takes into account the results of the Dagstuhl workshop, in particular those of the informal working group on multimodal meaning representation that was active during the workshop (see http://www.dfki.de/~wahlster/Dagstuhl_Multi_Modality, Working Group 4).</p></details> | <details><summary>Collo...</summary><p>Colloque avec actes et comité de lecture. internationale</p></details> |
| **[Deep Metric Loss for Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10486v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning often outperforms its unimodal counterparts by exploiting unimodal contributions and cross-modal interactions. However, focusing only on integrating multimodal features into a unified comprehensive representation overlooks the unimodal characteristics. In real data, the contributions of modalities can vary from instance to instance, and they often reinforce or conflict with each other. In this study, we introduce a novel \text{MultiModal} loss paradigm for multimodal learning, which subgroups instances according to their unimodal contributions. \text{MultiModal} loss can prevent inefficient learning caused by overfitting and efficiently optimize multimodal models. On synthetic data, \text{MultiModal} loss demonstrates improved classification performance by subgrouping difficult instances within certain modalities. On four real multimodal datasets, our loss is empirically shown to improve the performance of recent models. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of our loss. Additionally, we show that our loss generates a reliable prediction score for each modality, which is essential for subgrouping. Our \text{MultiModal} loss is a novel loss function to subgroup instances according to the contribution of modalities in multimodal learning and is applicable to a variety of multimodal models with unimodal decisions. Our code is available at https://github.com/SehwanMoon/MultiModalLoss.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Deep Multimodal Subspace Clustering Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06498v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches for unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering. The proposed framework consists of three main stages - multimodal encoder, self-expressive layer, and multimodal decoder. The encoder takes multimodal data as input and fuses them to a latent space representation. The self-expressive layer is responsible for enforcing the self-expressiveness property and acquiring an affinity matrix corresponding to the data points. The decoder reconstructs the original input data. The network uses the distance between the decoder's reconstruction and the original input in its training. We investigate early, late and intermediate fusion techniques and propose three different encoders corresponding to them for spatial fusion. The self-expressive layers and multimodal decoders are essentially the same for different spatial fusion-based approaches. In addition to various spatial fusion-based methods, an affinity fusion-based network is also proposed in which the self-expressive layer corresponding to different modalities is enforced to be the same. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art multimodal subspace clustering methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Negative Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20877v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm: "Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities' target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities, particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach against competing methods.

This omnivore model can take in any single-modality or multimodal data input indiscriminately (e.g., interleaved image, text and video) through a one-model-for-all autoregressive training process. First, visual signals are encoded into embeddings, and together with text tokens form an interleaved input sequence. Emu is then end-to-end trained with a unified objective of classifying the next text token or regressing the next visual embedding in the multimodal sequence. This versatile multimodality empowers the exploration of diverse pretraining data sources at scale, such as videos with interleaved frames and text, webpages with interleaved images and text, as well as web-scale image-text pairs and video-text pairs. Emu can serve as a generalist multimodal interface for both image-to-text and text-to-image tasks, and supports in-context image and text generation. Across a broad range of zero-shot/few-shot tasks including image captioning, visual question answering, video question answering and text-to-image generation, Emu demonstrates superb performance compared to state-of-the-art large multimodal models. Extended capabilities such as multimodal assistants via instruction tuning are also demonstrated with impressive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2024.

| **[A Survey on Image-text Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15857v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the significant advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the development of image-text multimodal models has garnered widespread attention. Current surveys on image-text multimodal models mainly focus on representative models or application domains, but lack a review on how general technical models influence the development of domain-specific models, which is crucial for domain researchers. Based on this, this paper first reviews the technological evolution of image-text multimodal models, from early explorations of feature space to visual language encoding structures, and then to the latest large model architectures. Next, from the perspective of technological evolution, we explain how the development of general image-text multimodal technologies promotes the progress of multimodal technologies in the biomedical field, as well as the importance and complexity of specific datasets in the biomedical domain. Then, centered on the tasks of image-text multimodal models, we analyze their common components and challenges. After that, we summarize the architecture, components, and data of general image-text multimodal models, and introduce the applications and improvements of image-text multimodal models in the biomedical field. Finally, we categorize the challenges faced in the development and application of general models into external factors and intrinsic factors, further refining them into 2 external factors and 5 intrinsic factors, and propose targeted solutions, providing guidance for future research directions.

| **[Multimodal Point-of-Interest Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03265v2)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models are applied to recommendation tasks such as items to buy and news articles to read. Point of Interest is quite a new area to sequential recommendation based on language representations of multimodal datasets. As a first step to prove our concepts, we focused on restaurant recommendation based on each user's past visit history. When choosing a next restaurant to visit, a user would consider genre and location of the venue and, if available, pictures of dishes served there. We created a pseudo restaurant check-in history dataset from the Foursquare dataset and the FoodX-251 dataset by converting pictures into text descriptions with a multimodal model called LLaVA, and used a language-based sequential recommendation framework named Recformer proposed in 2023. A model trained on this semi-multimodal dataset has outperformed another model trained on the same dataset without picture descriptions. This suggests that this semi-multimodal model reflects actual human behaviours and that our path to a multimodal recommendation model is in the right direction.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce visual context as the universal language-independent representation to facilitate multilingual translation. In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage the multimodal prompt to guide the Multimodal Multilingual neural Machine Translation (m3P), which aligns the representations of different languages with the same meaning and generates the conditional vision-language memory for translation. We construct a multilingual multimodal instruction dataset (InstrMulti102) to support 102 languages. Our method aims to minimize the representation distance of different languages by regarding the image as a central language. Experimental results show that m3P outperforms previous text-only baselines and multilingual multimodal methods by a large margin. Furthermore, the probing experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing translation under the low-resource and massively multilingual scenario.</p></details> | COLING 2024 |

However, while performance gains remain the gold standard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness are frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key research questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality con-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping fairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in multimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at inference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both performance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new modalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal models, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation measures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference degrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in real-world deployment. We conduct extensive experiments using multimodal healthcare datasets containing images, time series, and structured information to validate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Second Workshop on Responsible Generative AI</p></details> |

Yet, despite their advantage of weak supervision, they exhibit a gap in generative quality compared to unimodal VAEs, which are completely unsupervised. In an attempt to explain this gap, we uncover a fundamental limitation that applies to a large family of mixture-based multimodal VAEs. We prove that the sub-sampling of modalities enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal ELBO and thereby limits the generative quality of the respective models. Empirically, we showcase the generative quality gap on both synthetic and real data and present the tradeoffs between different variants of multimodal VAEs. We find that none of the existing approaches fulfills all desired criteria of an effective multimodal generative model when applied on more complex datasets than those used in previous benchmarks. In summary, we identify, formalize, and validate fundamental limitations of VAE-based approaches for modeling weakly-supervised data and discuss implications for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2022 camera-ready version</p></details> |

However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM), which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal robustness.</p></details> |  |

Unlike most existing methods that generate avatar-centric videos directly from multimodal inputs (e.g., text prompts), MagicAvatar explicitly disentangles avatar video generation into two stages: (1) multimodal-to-motion and (2) motion-to-video generation. The first stage translates the multimodal inputs into motion/ control signals (e.g., human pose, depth, DensePose); while the second stage generates avatar-centric video guided by these motion signals. Additionally, MagicAvatar supports avatar animation by simply providing a few images of the target person. This capability enables the animation of the provided human identity according to the specific motion derived from the first stage.

Notably, the research in cognitive psychology has demonstrated that information from multimodal sources always brings more powerful cognitive transfer than single modality sources. To this end, we introduce the new task of multimodal analogical reasoning over knowledge graphs, which requires multimodal reasoning ability with the help of background knowledge. Specifically, we construct a Multimodal Analogical Reasoning dataSet (MARS) and a multimodal knowledge graph MarKG. We evaluate with multimodal knowledge graph embedding and pre-trained Transformer baselines, illustrating the potential challenges of the proposed task.

However, in clinical practice, it is not always possible to acquire a complete set of MRIs, and the problem of missing modalities causes severe performance degradation in existing multimodal segmentation methods. In this work, we present the first attempt to exploit the Transformer for multimodal brain tumor segmentation that is robust to any combinatorial subset of available modalities. Concretely, we propose a novel multimodal Medical Transformer (mmFormer) for incomplete multimodal learning with three main components: the hybrid modality-specific encoders that bridge a convolutional encoder and an intra-modal Transformer for both local and global context modeling within each modality; an inter-modal Transformer to build and align the long-range correlations across modalities for modality-invariant features with global semantics corresponding to tumor region; a decoder that performs a progressive up-sampling and fusion with the modality-invariant features to generate robust segmentation. Besides, auxiliary regularizers are introduced in both encoder and decoder to further enhance the model's robustness to incomplete modalities. We conduct extensive experiments on the public BraTS $2018$ dataset for brain tumor segmentation. The results demonstrate that the proposed mmFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for incomplete multimodal brain tumor segmentation on almost all subsets of incomplete modalities, especially by an average 19.07% improvement of Dice on tumor segmentation with only one available modality.

At every step, the decoder uses this mechanism to focus on different parts of the source sentence to gather the most useful information before outputting its target word. Recently, the effectiveness of the attention mechanism has also been explored for multimodal tasks, where it becomes possible to focus both on sentence parts and image regions. Approaches to pool two modalities usually include element-wise product, sum or concatenation. In this paper, we evaluate the more advanced Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling method, which takes the outer product of two vectors to combine the attention features for the two modalities. This has been previously investigated for visual question answering. We try out this approach for multimodal image caption translation and show improvements compared to basic combination methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR Workshop 2017</p></details> |

The central challenge in multimodal learning involves learning representations that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. In this paper, we propose two methods for unsupervised learning of joint multimodal representations using sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) methods: a \textit{Seq2Seq Modality Translation Model} and a \textit{Hierarchical Seq2Seq Modality Translation Model}. We also explore multiple different variations on the multimodal inputs and outputs of these seq2seq models. Our experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis using the CMU-MOSI dataset indicate that our methods learn informative multimodal representations that outperform the baselines and achieve improved performance on multimodal sentiment analysis, specifically in the Bimodal case where our model is able to improve F1 Score by twelve points. We also discuss future directions for multimodal Seq2Seq methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages of content, 11 pages total, 2 figures.

To fully release the value of each modality and mitigate the influence of low-quality multimodal data, dynamic multimodal fusion emerges as a promising learning paradigm. Despite its widespread use, theoretical justifications in this field are still notably lacking. Can we design a provably robust multimodal fusion method? This paper provides theoretical understandings to answer this question under a most popular multimodal fusion framework from the generalization perspective. We proceed to reveal that several uncertainty estimation solutions are naturally available to achieve robust multimodal fusion. Then a novel multimodal fusion framework termed Quality-aware Multimodal Fusion (QMF) is proposed, which can improve the performance in terms of classification accuracy and model robustness. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks can support our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2023</p></details> |

Most existing works focus on a single task and design neural architectures manually, which are highly task-specific and hard to generalize to different tasks. In this paper, we devise a generalized deep multimodal neural architecture search (MMnas) framework for various multimodal learning tasks. Given multimodal input, we first define a set of primitive operations, and then construct a deep encoder-decoder based unified backbone, where each encoder or decoder block corresponds to an operation searched from a predefined operation pool. On top of the unified backbone, we attach task-specific heads to tackle different multimodal learning tasks. By using a gradient-based NAS algorithm, the optimal architectures for different tasks are learned efficiently. Extensive ablation studies, comprehensive analysis, and comparative experimental results show that the obtained MMnasNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across three multimodal learning tasks (over five datasets), including visual question answering, image-text matching, and visual grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to ACM MM2020, code available at https://github.com/MILVLG/mmnas/</p></details> |

| **[Representation Learning: A Statistical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11374v1)** | 2019-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning representations of data is an important problem in statistics and machine learning. While the origin of learning representations can be traced back to factor analysis and multidimensional scaling in statistics, it has become a central theme in deep learning with important applications in computer vision and computational neuroscience. In this article, we review recent advances in learning representations from a statistical perspective. In particular, we review the following two themes: (a) unsupervised learning of vector representations and (b) learning of both vector and matrix representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning sparse representations in reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01575v1)** | 2019-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms allow artificial agents to improve their selection of actions to increase rewarding experiences in their environments. Temporal Difference (TD) Learning -- a model-free RL method -- is a leading account of the midbrain dopamine system and the basal ganglia in reinforcement learning. These algorithms typically learn a mapping from the agent's current sensed state to a selected action (known as a policy function) via learning a value function (expected future rewards). TD Learning methods have been very successful on a broad range of control tasks, but learning can become intractably slow as the state space of the environment grows. This has motivated methods that learn internal representations of the agent's state, effectively reducing the size of the state space and restructuring state representations in order to support generalization. However, TD Learning coupled with an artificial neural network, as a function approximator, has been shown to fail to learn some fairly simple control tasks, challenging this explanation of reward-based learning. We hypothesize that such failures do not arise in the brain because of the ubiquitous presence of lateral inhibition in the cortex, producing sparse distributed internal representations that support the learning of expected future reward. The sparse conjunctive representations can avoid catastrophic interference while still supporting generalization. We provide support for this conjecture through computational simulations, demonstrating the benefits of learned sparse representations for three problematic classic control tasks: Puddle-world, Mountain-car, and Acrobot.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Representations Align: Universality in Representation Learning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09142v2)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks come in many sizes and architectures. The choice of architecture, in conjunction with the dataset and learning algorithm, is commonly understood to affect the learned neural representations. Yet, recent results have shown that different architectures learn representations with striking qualitative similarities. Here we derive an effective theory of representation learning under the assumption that the encoding map from input to hidden representation and the decoding map from representation to output are arbitrary smooth functions. This theory schematizes representation learning dynamics in the regime of complex, large architectures, where hidden representations are not strongly constrained by the parametrization. We show through experiments that the effective theory describes aspects of representation learning dynamics across a range of deep networks with different activation functions and architectures, and exhibits phenomena similar to the "rich" and "lazy" regime. While many network behaviors depend quantitatively on architecture, our findings point to certain behaviors that are widely conserved once models are sufficiently flexible.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Provable benefits of representation learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04601v1)** | 2017-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is general consensus that learning representations is useful for a variety of reasons, e.g. efficient use of labeled data (semi-supervised learning), transfer learning and understanding hidden structure of data. Popular techniques for representation learning include clustering, manifold learning, kernel-learning, autoencoders, Boltzmann machines, etc. To study the relative merits of these techniques, it's essential to formalize the definition and goals of representation learning, so that they are all become instances of the same definition. This paper introduces such a formal framework that also formalizes the utility of learning the representation. It is related to previous Bayesian notions, but with some new twists. We show the usefulness of our framework by exhibiting simple and natural settings -- linear mixture models and loglinear models, where the power of representation learning can be formally shown. In these examples, representation learning can be performed provably and efficiently under plausible assumptions (despite being NP-hard), and furthermore: (i) it greatly reduces the need for labeled data (semi-supervised learning) and (ii) it allows solving classification tasks when simpler approaches like nearest neighbors require too much data (iii) it is more powerful than manifold learning methods.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Socially Supervised Representation Learning: the Role of Subjectivity in Learning Efficient Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09390v4)** | 2022-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite its rise as a prominent solution to the data inefficiency of today's machine learning models, self-supervised learning has yet to be studied from a purely multi-agent perspective. In this work, we propose that aligning internal subjective representations, which naturally arise in a multi-agent setup where agents receive partial observations of the same underlying environmental state, can lead to more data-efficient representations. We propose that multi-agent environments, where agents do not have access to the observations of others but can communicate within a limited range, guarantees a common context that can be leveraged in individual representation learning. The reason is that subjective observations necessarily refer to the same subset of the underlying environmental states and that communication about these states can freely offer a supervised signal. To highlight the importance of communication, we refer to our setting as \textit{socially supervised representation learning}. We present a minimal architecture comprised of a population of autoencoders, where we define loss functions, capturing different aspects of effective communication, and examine their effect on the learned representations. We show that our proposed architecture allows the emergence of aligned representations. The subjectivity introduced by presenting agents with distinct perspectives of the environment state contributes to learning abstract representations that outperform those learned by a single autoencoder and a population of autoencoders, presented with identical perspectives of the environment state. Altogether, our results demonstrate how communication from subjective perspectives can lead to the acquisition of more abstract representations in multi-agent systems, opening promising perspectives for future research at the intersection of representation learning and emergent communication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Induced Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.11827v1)** | 2022-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of representation learning approaches for decision making in visually complex environments. Representation learning is essential for effective reinforcement learning (RL) from high-dimensional inputs. Unsupervised representation learning approaches based on reconstruction, prediction or contrastive learning have shown substantial learning efficiency gains. Yet, they have mostly been evaluated in clean laboratory or simulated settings. In contrast, real environments are visually complex and contain substantial amounts of clutter and distractors. Unsupervised representations will learn to model such distractors, potentially impairing the agent's learning efficiency. In contrast, an alternative class of approaches, which we call task-induced representation learning, leverages task information such as rewards or demonstrations from prior tasks to focus on task-relevant parts of the scene and ignore distractors. We investigate the effectiveness of unsupervised and task-induced representation learning approaches on four visually complex environments, from Distracting DMControl to the CARLA driving simulator. For both, RL and imitation learning, we find that representation learning generally improves sample efficiency on unseen tasks even in visually complex scenes and that task-induced representations can double learning efficiency compared to unsupervised alternatives.

| **[Meta-Learning Representations for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12588v2)** | 2019-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A continual learning agent should be able to build on top of existing knowledge to learn on new data quickly while minimizing forgetting. Current intelligent systems based on neural network function approximators arguably do the opposite---they are highly prone to forgetting and rarely trained to facilitate future learning. One reason for this poor behavior is that they learn from a representation that is not explicitly trained for these two goals. In this paper, we propose OML, an objective that directly minimizes catastrophic interference by learning representations that accelerate future learning and are robust to forgetting under online updates in continual learning. We show that it is possible to learn naturally sparse representations that are more effective for online updating. Moreover, our algorithm is complementary to existing continual learning strategies, such as MER and GEM. Finally, we demonstrate that a basic online updating strategy on representations learned by OML is competitive with rehearsal based methods for continual learning. We release an implementation of our method at https://github.com/khurramjaved96/mrcl .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS19, 15 pages, 10 figures, open-source, representation learning, continual learning, online learning</p></details> |
| **[Learning Sparse Representations Incrementally in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04002v1)** | 2019-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse representations have been shown to be useful in deep reinforcement learning for mitigating catastrophic interference and improving the performance of agents in terms of cumulative reward. Previous results were based on a two step process were the representation was learned offline and the action-value function was learned online afterwards. In this paper, we investigate if it is possible to learn a sparse representation and the action-value function simultaneously and incrementally. We investigate this question by employing several regularization techniques and observing how they affect sparsity of the representation learned by a DQN agent in two different benchmark domains. Our results show that with appropriate regularization it is possible to increase the sparsity of the representations learned by DQN agents. Moreover, we found that learning sparse representations also resulted in improved performance in terms of cumulative reward. Finally, we found that the performance of the agents that learned a sparse representation was more robust to the size of the experience replay buffer. This last finding supports the long standing hypothesis that the overlap in representations learned by deep neural networks is the leading cause of catastrophic interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Playful Interactions for Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09046v1)** | 2021-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key challenges in visual imitation learning is collecting large amounts of expert demonstrations for a given task. While methods for collecting human demonstrations are becoming easier with teleoperation methods and the use of low-cost assistive tools, we often still require 100-1000 demonstrations for every task to learn a visual representation and policy. To address this, we turn to an alternate form of data that does not require task-specific demonstrations -- play. Playing is a fundamental method children use to learn a set of skills and behaviors and visual representations in early learning. Importantly, play data is diverse, task-agnostic, and relatively cheap to obtain. In this work, we propose to use playful interactions in a self-supervised manner to learn visual representations for downstream tasks. We collect 2 hours of playful data in 19 diverse environments and use self-predictive learning to extract visual representations. Given these representations, we train policies using imitation learning for two downstream tasks: Pushing and Stacking. We demonstrate that our visual representations generalize better than standard behavior cloning and can achieve similar performance with only half the number of required demonstrations. Our representations, which are trained from scratch, compare favorably against ImageNet pretrained representations. Finally, we provide an experimental analysis on the effects of different pretraining modes on downstream task learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning by Learning to Count](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.06734v1)** | 2017-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel method for representation learning that uses an artificial supervision signal based on counting visual primitives. This supervision signal is obtained from an equivariance relation, which does not require any manual annotation. We relate transformations of images to transformations of the representations. More specifically, we look for the representation that satisfies such relation rather than the transformations that match a given representation. In this paper, we use two image transformations in the context of counting: scaling and tiling. The first transformation exploits the fact that the number of visual primitives should be invariant to scale. The second transformation allows us to equate the total number of visual primitives in each tile to that in the whole image. These two transformations are combined in one constraint and used to train a neural network with a contrastive loss. The proposed task produces representations that perform on par or exceed the state of the art in transfer learning benchmarks.</p></details> | ICCV 2017(oral) |
| **[Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.5538v3)** | 2014-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, auto-encoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer-term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation and manifold learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Matryoshka Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13147v4)** | 2024-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned representations are a central component in modern ML systems, serving a multitude of downstream tasks. When training such representations, it is often the case that computational and statistical constraints for each downstream task are unknown. In this context rigid, fixed capacity representations can be either over or under-accommodating to the task at hand. This leads us to ask: can we design a flexible representation that can adapt to multiple downstream tasks with varying computational resources? Our main contribution is Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) which encodes information at different granularities and allows a single embedding to adapt to the computational constraints of downstream tasks. MRL minimally modifies existing representation learning pipelines and imposes no additional cost during inference and deployment. MRL learns coarse-to-fine representations that are at least as accurate and rich as independently trained low-dimensional representations. The flexibility within the learned Matryoshka Representations offer: (a) up to 14x smaller embedding size for ImageNet-1K classification at the same level of accuracy; (b) up to 14x real-world speed-ups for large-scale retrieval on ImageNet-1K and 4K; and (c) up to 2% accuracy improvements for long-tail few-shot classification, all while being as robust as the original representations. Finally, we show that MRL extends seamlessly to web-scale datasets (ImageNet, JFT) across various modalities -- vision (ViT, ResNet), vision + language (ALIGN) and language (BERT). MRL code and pretrained models are open-sourced at https://github.com/RAIVNLab/MRL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Edite...</summary><p>Edited related work to include intrinsic dimensionality works</p></details> |
| **[Flow Factorized Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13167v1)** | 2023-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prominent goal of representation learning research is to achieve representations which are factorized in a useful manner with respect to the ground truth factors of variation. The fields of disentangled and equivariant representation learning have approached this ideal from a range of complimentary perspectives; however, to date, most approaches have proven to either be ill-specified or insufficiently flexible to effectively separate all realistic factors of interest in a learned latent space. In this work, we propose an alternative viewpoint on such structured representation learning which we call Flow Factorized Representation Learning, and demonstrate it to learn both more efficient and more usefully structured representations than existing frameworks. Specifically, we introduce a generative model which specifies a distinct set of latent probability paths that define different input transformations. Each latent flow is generated by the gradient field of a learned potential following dynamic optimal transport. Our novel setup brings new understandings to both \textit{disentanglement} and \textit{equivariance}. We show that our model achieves higher likelihoods on standard representation learning benchmarks while simultaneously being closer to approximately equivariant models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the transformations learned by our model are flexibly composable and can also extrapolate to new data, implying a degree of robustness and generalizability approaching the ultimate goal of usefully factorized representation learning.</p></details> | NeurIPS23 |
| **[Towards Unsupervised Representation Learning: Learning, Evaluating and Transferring Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00101v1)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised representation learning aims at finding methods that learn representations from data without annotation-based signals. Abstaining from annotations not only leads to economic benefits but may - and to some extent already does - result in advantages regarding the representation's structure, robustness, and generalizability to different tasks. In the long run, unsupervised methods are expected to surpass their supervised counterparts due to the reduction of human intervention and the inherently more general setup that does not bias the optimization towards an objective originating from specific annotation-based signals. While major advantages of unsupervised representation learning have been recently observed in natural language processing, supervised methods still dominate in vision domains for most tasks. In this dissertation, we contribute to the field of unsupervised (visual) representation learning from three perspectives: (i) Learning representations: We design unsupervised, backpropagation-free Convolutional Self-Organizing Neural Networks (CSNNs) that utilize self-organization- and Hebbian-based learning rules to learn convolutional kernels and masks to achieve deeper backpropagation-free models. (ii) Evaluating representations: We build upon the widely used (non-)linear evaluation protocol to define pretext- and target-objective-independent metrics for measuring and investigating the objective function mismatch between various unsupervised pretext tasks and target tasks. (iii) Transferring representations: We contribute CARLANE, the first 3-way sim-to-real domain adaptation benchmark for 2D lane detection, and a method based on prototypical self-supervised learning. Finally, we contribute a content-consistent unpaired image-to-image translation method that utilizes masks, global and local discriminators, and similarity sampling to mitigate content inconsistencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, 223 pages, Abstract in English, Spanish and Catalan, 4 appendices</p></details> |
| **[Contextures: The Mechanism of Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19792v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This dissertation establishes the contexture theory to mathematically characterize the mechanism of representation learning, or pretraining. Despite the remarkable empirical success of foundation models, it is not very clear what representations they learn, and why these representations are useful for various downstream tasks. A scientific understanding of representation learning is critical, especially at this point when scaling up the model size is producing diminishing returns, and designing new pretraining methods is imperative for further progress. Prior work treated different representation learning methods quite differently, whereas the contexture theory provides a unified framework for analyzing these methods. The central argument is that a representation is learned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We prove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association, in which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be optimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context. We also show that a context is the most useful when the association between X and A is neither too strong nor too weak. The important implication of the contexture theory is that increasing the model size alone will achieve diminishing returns, and further advancements require better contexts. We demonstrate that many pretraining objectives can learn the contexture, including supervised learning, self-supervised learning, generative models, etc. Then, we introduce two general objectives -- SVME and KISE, for learning the contexture. We also show how to mix multiple contexts together, an effortless way to create better contexts from existing ones. Then, we prove statistical learning bounds for representation learning. Finally, we discuss the effect of the data distribution shift from pretraining to the downstream task.</p></details> | PhD Dissertation |

| **[Non-Parametric Representation Learning with Kernels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02028v1)** | 2023-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised and self-supervised representation learning has become popular in recent years for learning useful features from unlabelled data. Representation learning has been mostly developed in the neural network literature, and other models for representation learning are surprisingly unexplored. In this work, we introduce and analyze several kernel-based representation learning approaches: Firstly, we define two kernel Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models using contrastive loss functions and secondly, a Kernel Autoencoder (AE) model based on the idea of embedding and reconstructing data. We argue that the classical representer theorems for supervised kernel machines are not always applicable for (self-supervised) representation learning, and present new representer theorems, which show that the representations learned by our kernel models can be expressed in terms of kernel matrices. We further derive generalisation error bounds for representation learning with kernel SSL and AE, and empirically evaluate the performance of these methods in both small data regimes as well as in comparison with neural network based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Growing Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08857v1)** | 2021-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning continues to grow in popularity due to its ability to learn increasingly complex tasks. However, for many supervised models, the shift in a data distribution or the appearance of a new event can result in a severe decrease in model performance. Retraining a model from scratch with updated data can be resource intensive or impossible depending on the constraints placed on an organization or system. Continual learning methods attempt to adapt models to new classes instead of retraining. However, many of these methods do not have a detection method for new classes or make assumptions about the distribution of classes. In this paper, we develop an attention based Gaussian Mixture, called GMAT, that learns interpretable representations of data with or without labels. We incorporate this method with existing Neural Architecture Search techniques to develop an algorithm for detection new events for an optimal number of representations through an iterative process of training a growing. We show that our method is capable learning new representations of data without labels or assumptions about the distributions of labels. We additionally develop a method that allows our model to utilize labels to more accurately develop representations. Lastly, we show that our method can avoid catastrophic forgetting by replaying samples from learned representations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Exploratory State Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13596v2)** | 2022-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Not having access to compact and meaningful representations is known to significantly increase the complexity of reinforcement learning (RL). For this reason, it can be useful to perform state representation learning (SRL) before tackling RL tasks. However, obtaining a good state representation can only be done if a large diversity of transitions is observed, which can require a difficult exploration, especially if the environment is initially reward-free. To solve the problems of exploration and SRL in parallel, we propose a new approach called XSRL (eXploratory State Representation Learning). On one hand, it jointly learns compact state representations and a state transition estimator which is used to remove unexploitable information from the representations. On the other hand, it continuously trains an inverse model, and adds to the prediction error of this model a $k$-step learning progress bonus to form the maximization objective of a discovery policy. This results in a policy that seeks complex transitions from which the trained models can effectively learn. Our experimental results show that the approach leads to efficient exploration in challenging environments with image observations, and to state representations that significantly accelerate learning in RL tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Desiderata for Representation Learning: A Causal Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03795v2)** | 2022-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning constructs low-dimensional representations to summarize essential features of high-dimensional data. This learning problem is often approached by describing various desiderata associated with learned representations; e.g., that they be non-spurious, efficient, or disentangled. It can be challenging, however, to turn these intuitive desiderata into formal criteria that can be measured and enhanced based on observed data. In this paper, we take a causal perspective on representation learning, formalizing non-spuriousness and efficiency (in supervised representation learning) and disentanglement (in unsupervised representation learning) using counterfactual quantities and observable consequences of causal assertions. This yields computable metrics that can be used to assess the degree to which representations satisfy the desiderata of interest and learn non-spurious and disentangled representations from single observational datasets.</p></details> | 68 pages |
| **[Region Similarity Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.12902v2)** | 2021-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Region Similarity Representation Learning (ReSim), a new approach to self-supervised representation learning for localization-based tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While existing work has largely focused on solely learning global representations for an entire image, ReSim learns both regional representations for localization as well as semantic image-level representations. ReSim operates by sliding a fixed-sized window across the overlapping area between two views (e.g., image crops), aligning these areas with their corresponding convolutional feature map regions, and then maximizing the feature similarity across views. As a result, ReSim learns spatially and semantically consistent feature representation throughout the convolutional feature maps of a neural network. A shift or scale of an image region, e.g., a shift or scale of an object, has a corresponding change in the feature maps; this allows downstream tasks to leverage these representations for localization. Through object detection, instance segmentation, and dense pose estimation experiments, we illustrate how ReSim learns representations which significantly improve the localization and classification performance compared to a competitive MoCo-v2 baseline: $+2.7$ AP$^{\text{bb}}_{75}$ VOC, $+1.1$ AP$^{\text{bb}}_{75}$ COCO, and $+1.9$ AP$^{\text{mk}}$ Cityscapes.

| **[Feature Forgetting in Continual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13359v1)** | 2022-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In continual and lifelong learning, good representation learning can help increase performance and reduce sample complexity when learning new tasks. There is evidence that representations do not suffer from "catastrophic forgetting" even in plain continual learning, but little further fact is known about its characteristics. In this paper, we aim to gain more understanding about representation learning in continual learning, especially on the feature forgetting problem. We devise a protocol for evaluating representation in continual learning, and then use it to present an overview of the basic trends of continual representation learning, showing its consistent deficiency and potential issues. To study the feature forgetting problem, we create a synthetic dataset to identify and visualize the prevalence of feature forgetting in neural networks. Finally, we propose a simple technique using gating adapters to mitigate feature forgetting. We conclude by discussing that improving representation learning benefits both old and new tasks in continual learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Generalization of Representations in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00543v1)** | 2022-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning, state representations are used to tractably deal with large problem spaces. State representations serve both to approximate the value function with few parameters, but also to generalize to newly encountered states. Their features may be learned implicitly (as part of a neural network) or explicitly (for example, the successor representation of \citet{dayan1993improving}). While the approximation properties of representations are reasonably well-understood, a precise characterization of how and when these representations generalize is lacking. In this work, we address this gap and provide an informative bound on the generalization error arising from a specific state representation. This bound is based on the notion of effective dimension which measures the degree to which knowing the value at one state informs the value at other states. Our bound applies to any state representation and quantifies the natural tension between representations that generalize well and those that approximate well. We complement our theoretical results with an empirical survey of classic representation learning methods from the literature and results on the Arcade Learning Environment, and find that the generalization behaviour of learned representations is well-explained by their effective dimension.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AISTATS22</p></details> |
| **[Simplicial Complex Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04046v6)** | 2022-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simplicial complexes form an important class of topological spaces that are frequently used in many application areas such as computer-aided design, computer graphics, and simulation. Representation learning on graphs, which are just 1-d simplicial complexes, has witnessed a great attention in recent years. However, there has not been enough effort to extend representation learning to higher dimensional simplicial objects due to the additional complexity these objects hold, especially when it comes to entire-simplicial complex representation learning. In this work, we propose a method for simplicial complex-level representation learning that embeds a simplicial complex to a universal embedding space in a way that complex-to-complex proximity is preserved. Our method uses our novel geometric message passing schemes to learn an entire simplicial complex representation in an end-to-end fashion. We demonstrate the proposed model on publicly available mesh dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first method for learning simplicial complex-level representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MACHI...</summary><p>MACHINE LEARNING ON GRAPHS, MLoG Workshop at WSDM'22</p></details> |

| **[Disentangled Generative Graph Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13471v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, generative graph models have shown promising results in learning graph representations through self-supervised methods. However, most existing generative graph representation learning (GRL) approaches rely on random masking across the entire graph, which overlooks the entanglement of learned representations. This oversight results in non-robustness and a lack of explainability. Furthermore, disentangling the learned representations remains a significant challenge and has not been sufficiently explored in GRL research. Based on these insights, this paper introduces DiGGR (Disentangled Generative Graph Representation Learning), a self-supervised learning framework. DiGGR aims to learn latent disentangled factors and utilizes them to guide graph mask modeling, thereby enhancing the disentanglement of learned representations and enabling end-to-end joint learning. Extensive experiments on 11 public datasets for two different graph learning tasks demonstrate that DiGGR consistently outperforms many previous self-supervised methods, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

Learning such representations without supervision from rewards is a challenging open problem. We introduce a method that learns state representations by maximizing mutual information across spatially and temporally distinct features of a neural encoder of the observations. We also introduce a new benchmark based on Atari 2600 games where we evaluate representations based on how well they capture the ground truth state variables. We believe this new framework for evaluating representation learning models will be crucial for future representation learning research. Finally, we compare our technique with other state-of-the-art generative and contrastive representation learning methods.

We show how a policy can be decomposed into a component that acts in a low-dimensional space of action representations and a component that transforms these representations into actual actions. These representations improve generalization over large, finite action sets by allowing the agent to infer the outcomes of actions similar to actions already taken. We provide an algorithm to both learn and use action representations and provide conditions for its convergence. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated on large-scale real-world problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2019)</p></details> |

By subverting the need for supervised labels, such approaches are able to utilize the numerous unlabeled images that exist on the Internet and in photographic datasets. Yet to build truly intelligent agents, we must construct representation learning algorithms that can learn not only from datasets but also learn from environments. An agent in a natural environment will not typically be fed curated data. Instead, it must explore its environment to acquire the data it will learn from. We propose a framework, curious representation learning (CRL), which jointly learns a reinforcement learning policy and a visual representation model. The policy is trained to maximize the error of the representation learner, and in doing so is incentivized to explore its environment. At the same time, the learned representation becomes stronger and stronger as the policy feeds it ever harder data to learn from. Our learned representations enable promising transfer to downstream navigation tasks, performing better than or comparably to ImageNet pretraining without using any supervision at all. In addition, despite being trained in simulation, our learned representations can obtain interpretable results on real images.

| **[Mutual Contrastive Learning for Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12565v2)** | 2022-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a collaborative learning method called Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) for general visual representation learning. The core idea of MCL is to perform mutual interaction and transfer of contrastive distributions among a cohort of networks. A crucial component of MCL is Interactive Contrastive Learning (ICL). Compared with vanilla contrastive learning, ICL can aggregate cross-network embedding information and maximize the lower bound to the mutual information between two networks. This enables each network to learn extra contrastive knowledge from others, leading to better feature representations for visual recognition tasks. We emphasize that the resulting MCL is conceptually simple yet empirically powerful. It is a generic framework that can be applied to both supervised and self-supervised representation learning. Experimental results on image classification and transfer learning to object detection show that MCL can lead to consistent performance gains, demonstrating that MCL can guide the network to generate better feature representations.

The process of separating underlying factors of variation into variables with semantic meaning benefits in learning explainable representations of data, which imitates the meaningful understanding process of humans when observing an object or relation. As a general learning strategy, DRL has demonstrated its power in improving the model explainability, controlability, robustness, as well as generalization capacity in a wide range of scenarios such as computer vision, natural language processing, and data mining. In this article, we comprehensively investigate DRL from various aspects including motivations, definitions, methodologies, evaluations, applications, and model designs. We first present two well-recognized definitions, i.e., Intuitive Definition and Group Theory Definition for disentangled representation learning. We further categorize the methodologies for DRL into four groups from the following perspectives, the model type, representation structure, supervision signal, and independence assumption. We also analyze principles to design different DRL models that may benefit different tasks in practical applications. Finally, we point out challenges in DRL as well as potential research directions deserving future investigations. We believe this work may provide insights for promoting the DRL research in the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Provable Benefit of Multitask Representation Learning in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.05900v1)** | 2022-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As representation learning becomes a powerful technique to reduce sample complexity in reinforcement learning (RL) in practice, theoretical understanding of its advantage is still limited. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the benefit of representation learning under the low-rank Markov decision process (MDP) model. We first study multitask low-rank RL (as upstream training), where all tasks share a common representation, and propose a new multitask reward-free algorithm called REFUEL. REFUEL learns both the transition kernel and the near-optimal policy for each task, and outputs a well-learned representation for downstream tasks. Our result demonstrates that multitask representation learning is provably more sample-efficient than learning each task individually, as long as the total number of tasks is above a certain threshold. We then study the downstream RL in both online and offline settings, where the agent is assigned with a new task sharing the same representation as the upstream tasks. For both online and offline settings, we develop a sample-efficient algorithm, and show that it finds a near-optimal policy with the suboptimality gap bounded by the sum of the estimation error of the learned representation in upstream and a vanishing term as the number of downstream samples becomes large. Our downstream results of online and offline RL further capture the benefit of employing the learned representation from upstream as opposed to learning the representation of the low-rank model directly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study that characterizes the benefit of representation learning in exploration-based reward-free multitask RL for both upstream and downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication</p></details> |
| **[On the Generalization of Learned Structured Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13001v1)** | 2023-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite tremendous progress over the past decade, deep learning methods generally fall short of human-level systematic generalization. It has been argued that explicitly capturing the underlying structure of data should allow connectionist systems to generalize in a more predictable and systematic manner. Indeed, evidence in humans suggests that interpreting the world in terms of symbol-like compositional entities may be crucial for intelligent behavior and high-level reasoning. Another common limitation of deep learning systems is that they require large amounts of training data, which can be expensive to obtain. In representation learning, large datasets are leveraged to learn generic data representations that may be useful for efficient learning of arbitrary downstream tasks. This thesis is about structured representation learning. We study methods that learn, with little or no supervision, representations of unstructured data that capture its hidden structure. In the first part of the thesis, we focus on representations that disentangle the explanatory factors of variation of the data. We scale up disentangled representation learning to a novel robotic dataset, and perform a systematic large-scale study on the role of pretrained representations for out-of-distribution generalization in downstream robotic tasks. The second part of this thesis focuses on object-centric representations, which capture the compositional structure of the input in terms of symbol-like entities, such as objects in visual scenes. Object-centric learning methods learn to form meaningful entities from unstructured input, enabling symbolic information processing on a connectionist substrate. In this study, we train a selection of methods on several common datasets, and investigate their usefulness for downstream tasks and their ability to generalize out of distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor revision of my PhD thesis: fixed hyperlinks, fixed minor typos, and compressed images.

| **[Steerable Equivariant Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.11349v1)** | 2023-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained deep image representations are useful for post-training tasks such as classification through transfer learning, image retrieval, and object detection. Data augmentations are a crucial aspect of pre-training robust representations in both supervised and self-supervised settings. Data augmentations explicitly or implicitly promote invariance in the embedding space to the input image transformations. This invariance reduces generalization to those downstream tasks which rely on sensitivity to these particular data augmentations. In this paper, we propose a method of learning representations that are instead equivariant to data augmentations. We achieve this equivariance through the use of steerable representations. Our representations can be manipulated directly in embedding space via learned linear maps. We demonstrate that our resulting steerable and equivariant representations lead to better performance on transfer learning and robustness: e.g. we improve linear probe top-1 accuracy by between 1% to 3% for transfer; and ImageNet-C accuracy by upto 3.4%. We further show that the steerability of our representations provides significant speedup (nearly 50x) for test-time augmentations; by applying a large number of augmentations for out-of-distribution detection, we significantly improve OOD AUC on the ImageNet-C dataset over an invariant representation.</p></details> |  |

However, recent CL advances are restricted to supervised continual learning (SCL) scenarios. Consequently, they are not scalable to real-world applications where the data distribution is often biased and unannotated. In this work, we focus on unsupervised continual learning (UCL), where we learn the feature representations on an unlabelled sequence of tasks and show that reliance on annotated data is not necessary for continual learning. We conduct a systematic study analyzing the learned feature representations and show that unsupervised visual representations are surprisingly more robust to catastrophic forgetting, consistently achieve better performance, and generalize better to out-of-distribution tasks than SCL. Furthermore, we find that UCL achieves a smoother loss landscape through qualitative analysis of the learned representations and learns meaningful feature representations. Additionally, we propose Lifelong Unsupervised Mixup (LUMP), a simple yet effective technique that interpolates between the current task and previous tasks' instances to alleviate catastrophic forgetting for unsupervised representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR (Oral) 2022.

Furthermore, we examine downstream RL in reward-free, offline and online scenarios, where a new task is introduced to the agent that shares the same representation as the upstream offline tasks.

| **[Deep Inverse Feature Learning: A Representation Learning of Error](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04285v1)** | 2020-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel perspective about error in machine learning and proposes inverse feature learning (IFL) as a representation learning approach that learns a set of high-level features based on the representation of error for classification or clustering purposes. The proposed perspective about error representation is fundamentally different from current learning methods, where in classification approaches they interpret the error as a function of the differences between the true labels and the predicted ones or in clustering approaches, in which the clustering objective functions such as compactness are used. Inverse feature learning method operates based on a deep clustering approach to obtain a qualitative form of the representation of error as features. The performance of the proposed IFL method is evaluated by applying the learned features along with the original features, or just using the learned features in different classification and clustering techniques for several data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method leads to promising results in classification and especially in clustering. In classification, the proposed features along with the primary features improve the results of most of the classification methods on several popular data sets. In clustering, the performance of different clustering methods is considerably improved on different data sets. There are interesting results that show some few features of the representation of error capture highly informative aspects of primary features. We hope this paper helps to utilize the error representation learning in different feature learning domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Matryoshka Representation Learning for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07432v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning is essential for deep-neural-network-based recommender systems to capture user preferences and item features within fixed-dimensional user and item vectors. Unlike existing representation learning methods that either treat each user preference and item feature uniformly or categorize them into discrete clusters, we argue that in the real world, user preferences and item features are naturally expressed and organized in a hierarchical manner, leading to a new direction for representation learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel matryoshka representation learning method for recommendation (MRL4Rec), by which we restructure user and item vectors into matryoshka representations with incrementally dimensional and overlapping vector spaces to explicitly represent user preferences and item features at different hierarchical levels. We theoretically establish that constructing training triplets specific to each level is pivotal in guaranteeing accurate matryoshka representation learning. Subsequently, we propose the matryoshka negative sampling mechanism to construct training triplets, which further ensures the effectiveness of the matryoshka representation learning in capturing hierarchical user preferences and item features. The experiments demonstrate that MRL4Rec can consistently and substantially outperform a number of state-of-the-art competitors on several real-life datasets.

| **[Neural Discrete Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00937v2)** | 2018-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning useful representations without supervision remains a key challenge in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful generative model that learns such discrete representations. Our model, the Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE), differs from VAEs in two key ways: the encoder network outputs discrete, rather than continuous, codes; and the prior is learnt rather than static. In order to learn a discrete latent representation, we incorporate ideas from vector quantisation (VQ). Using the VQ method allows the model to circumvent issues of "posterior collapse" -- where the latents are ignored when they are paired with a powerful autoregressive decoder -- typically observed in the VAE framework. Pairing these representations with an autoregressive prior, the model can generate high quality images, videos, and speech as well as doing high quality speaker conversion and unsupervised learning of phonemes, providing further evidence of the utility of the learnt representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Interpretable Fair Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16698v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous approaches have been recently proposed for learning fair representations that mitigate unfair outcomes in prediction tasks. A key motivation for these methods is that the representations can be used by third parties with unknown objectives. However, because current fair representations are generally not interpretable, the third party cannot use these fair representations for exploration, or to obtain any additional insights, besides the pre-contracted prediction tasks. Thus, to increase data utility beyond prediction tasks, we argue that the representations need to be fair, yet interpretable. We propose a general framework for learning interpretable fair representations by introducing an interpretable "prior knowledge" during the representation learning process. We implement this idea and conduct experiments with ColorMNIST and Dsprite datasets. The results indicate that in addition to being interpretable, our representations attain slightly higher accuracy and fairer outcomes in a downstream classification task compared to state-of-the-art fair representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning with Prototypical Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11271v2)** | 2021-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning effective representations in image-based environments is crucial for sample efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unfortunately, in RL, representation learning is confounded with the exploratory experience of the agent -- learning a useful representation requires diverse data, while effective exploration is only possible with coherent representations. Furthermore, we would like to learn representations that not only generalize across tasks but also accelerate downstream exploration for efficient task-specific training. To address these challenges we propose Proto-RL, a self-supervised framework that ties representation learning with exploration through prototypical representations. These prototypes simultaneously serve as a summarization of the exploratory experience of an agent as well as a basis for representing observations. We pre-train these task-agnostic representations and prototypes on environments without downstream task information. This enables state-of-the-art downstream policy learning on a set of difficult continuous control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fairness by Learning Orthogonal Disentangled Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05707v3)** | 2020-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning discriminative powerful representations is a crucial step for machine learning systems. Introducing invariance against arbitrary nuisance or sensitive attributes while performing well on specific tasks is an important problem in representation learning. This is mostly approached by purging the sensitive information from learned representations. In this paper, we propose a novel disentanglement approach to invariant representation problem. We disentangle the meaningful and sensitive representations by enforcing orthogonality constraints as a proxy for independence. We explicitly enforce the meaningful representation to be agnostic to sensitive information by entropy maximization. The proposed approach is evaluated on five publicly available datasets and compared with state of the art methods for learning fairness and invariance achieving the state of the art performance on three datasets and comparable performance on the rest. Further, we perform an ablative study to evaluate the effect of each component.</p></details> |  |
| **[A manifold learning perspective on representation learning: Learning decoder and representations without an encoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13910v2)** | 2021-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoencoders are commonly used in representation learning. They consist of an encoder and a decoder, which provide a straightforward way to map n-dimensional data in input space to a lower m-dimensional representation space and back. The decoder itself defines an m-dimensional manifold in input space. Inspired by manifold learning, we show that the decoder can be trained on its own by learning the representations of the training samples along with the decoder weights using gradient descent. A sum-of-squares loss then corresponds to optimizing the manifold to have the smallest Euclidean distance to the training samples, and similarly for other loss functions. We derive expressions for the number of samples needed to specify the encoder and decoder and show that the decoder generally requires much less training samples to be well-specified compared to the encoder. We discuss training of autoencoders in this perspective and relate to previous work in the field that use noisy training examples and other types of regularization. On the natural image data sets MNIST and CIFAR10, we demonstrate that the decoder is much better suited to learn a low-dimensional representation, especially when trained on small data sets. Using simulated gene regulatory data, we further show that the decoder alone leads to better generalization and meaningful representations. Our approach of training the decoder alone facilitates representation learning even on small data sets and can lead to improved training of autoencoders. We hope that the simple analyses presented will also contribute to an improved conceptual understanding of representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Investigation of Representation Learning for Imitation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.07886v1)** | 2022-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning often needs a large demonstration set in order to handle the full range of situations that an agent might find itself in during deployment. However, collecting expert demonstrations can be expensive. Recent work in vision, reinforcement learning, and NLP has shown that auxiliary representation learning objectives can reduce the need for large amounts of expensive, task-specific data. Our Empirical Investigation of Representation Learning for Imitation (EIRLI) investigates whether similar benefits apply to imitation learning. We propose a modular framework for constructing representation learning algorithms, then use our framework to evaluate the utility of representation learning for imitation across several environment suites. In the settings we evaluate, we find that existing algorithms for image-based representation learning provide limited value relative to a well-tuned baseline with image augmentations. To explain this result, we investigate differences between imitation learning and other settings where representation learning has provided significant benefit, such as image classification. Finally, we release a well-documented codebase which both replicates our findings and provides a modular framework for creating new representation learning algorithms out of reusable components.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS2021 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |

Belief representations, which characterize the distribution over the latent states in a POMDP, have been modeled using recurrent neural networks and probabilistic latent variable models, and shown to be effective for reinforcement learning in POMDPs. In this work, we investigate the belief representation learning problem for generative adversarial imitation learning in POMDPs. Instead of training the belief module and the policy separately as suggested in prior work, we learn the belief module jointly with the policy, using a task-aware imitation loss to ensure that the representation is more aligned with the policy's objective. To improve robustness of representation, we introduce several informative belief regularization techniques, including multi-step prediction of dynamics and action-sequences. Evaluated on various partially observable continuous-control locomotion tasks, our belief-module imitation learning approach (BMIL) substantially outperforms several baselines, including the original GAIL algorithm and the task-agnostic belief learning algorithm. Extensive ablation analysis indicates the effectiveness of task-aware belief learning and belief regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2019)</p></details> |

We take the perspective of a learning agent that is interested in recognizing object instances in an open dynamic universe in a way in which any update to its internal feature representation does not render the features in the gallery unusable for visual search. We refer to this learning problem as Compatible Lifelong Learning Representations (CL2R) as it considers compatible representation learning within the lifelong learning paradigm. We identify stationarity as the property that the feature representation is required to hold to achieve compatibility and propose a novel training procedure that encourages local and global stationarity on the learned representation. Due to stationarity, the statistical properties of the learned features do not change over time, making them interoperable with previously learned features. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that our CL2R training procedure outperforms alternative baselines and state-of-the-art methods. We also provide novel metrics to specifically evaluate compatible representation learning under catastrophic forgetting in various sequential learning tasks.

| **[Inverse Feature Learning: Feature learning based on Representation Learning of Error](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03689v1)** | 2020-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes inverse feature learning as a novel supervised feature learning technique that learns a set of high-level features for classification based on an error representation approach. The key contribution of this method is to learn the representation of error as high-level features, while current representation learning methods interpret error by loss functions which are obtained as a function of differences between the true labels and the predicted ones. One advantage of such learning method is that the learned features for each class are independent of learned features for other classes; therefore, this method can learn simultaneously meaning that it can learn new classes without retraining. Error representation learning can also help with generalization and reduce the chance of over-fitting by adding a set of impactful features to the original data set which capture the relationships between each instance and different classes through an error generation and analysis process. This method can be particularly effective in data sets, where the instances of each class have diverse feature representations or the ones with imbalanced classes. The experimental results show that the proposed method results in significantly better performance compared to the state-of-the-art classification techniques for several popular data sets. We hope this paper can open a new path to utilize the proposed perspective of error representation learning in different feature learning domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Internal Representations (COLT 1995)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05781v3)** | 2019-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probably the most important problem in machine learning is the preliminary biasing of a learner's hypothesis space so that it is small enough to ensure good generalisation from reasonable training sets, yet large enough that it contains a good solution to the problem being learnt. In this paper a mechanism for {\em automatically} learning or biasing the learner's hypothesis space is introduced. It works by first learning an appropriate {\em internal representation} for a learning environment and then using that representation to bias the learner's hypothesis space for the learning of future tasks drawn from the same environment. An internal representation must be learnt by sampling from {\em many similar tasks}, not just a single task as occurs in ordinary machine learning. It is proved that the number of examples $m$ {\em per task} required to ensure good generalisation from a representation learner obeys $m = O(a+b/n)$ where $n$ is the number of tasks being learnt and $a$ and $b$ are constants. If the tasks are learnt independently ({\em i.e.} without a common representation) then $m=O(a+b)$. It is argued that for learning environments such as speech and character recognition $b\gg a$ and hence representation learning in these environments can potentially yield a drastic reduction in the number of examples required per task. It is also proved that if $n = O(b)$ (with $m=O(a+b/n)$) then the representation learnt will be good for learning novel tasks from the same environment, and that the number of examples required to generalise well on a novel task will be reduced to $O(a)$ (as opposed to $O(a+b)$ if no representation is used). It is shown that gradient descent can be used to train neural network representations and experiment results are reported providing strong qualitative support for the theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

| **[Near-Optimal Representation Learning for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01257v2)** | 2019-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of representation learning in goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning. In such hierarchical structures, a higher-level controller solves tasks by iteratively communicating goals which a lower-level policy is trained to reach. Accordingly, the choice of representation -- the mapping of observation space to goal space -- is crucial. To study this problem, we develop a notion of sub-optimality of a representation, defined in terms of expected reward of the optimal hierarchical policy using this representation. We derive expressions which bound the sub-optimality and show how these expressions can be translated to representation learning objectives which may be optimized in practice. Results on a number of difficult continuous-control tasks show that our approach to representation learning yields qualitatively better representations as well as quantitatively better hierarchical policies, compared to existing methods (see videos at https://sites.google.com/view/representation-hrl).</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2019 Conference Paper</p></details> |
| **[An efficient framework for learning sentence representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02893v1)** | 2018-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we propose a simple and efficient framework for learning sentence representations from unlabelled data. Drawing inspiration from the distributional hypothesis and recent work on learning sentence representations, we reformulate the problem of predicting the context in which a sentence appears as a classification problem. Given a sentence and its context, a classifier distinguishes context sentences from other contrastive sentences based on their vector representations. This allows us to efficiently learn different types of encoding functions, and we show that the model learns high-quality sentence representations. We demonstrate that our sentence representations outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised representation learning methods on several downstream NLP tasks that involve understanding sentence semantics while achieving an order of magnitude speedup in training time.</p></details> | ICLR 2018 |
| **[Learning Graph Representations with Embedding Propagation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03059v1)** | 2017-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Embedding Propagation (EP), an unsupervised learning framework for graph-structured data. EP learns vector representations of graphs by passing two types of messages between neighboring nodes. Forward messages consist of label representations such as representations of words and other attributes associated with the nodes. Backward messages consist of gradients that result from aggregating the label representations and applying a reconstruction loss. Node representations are finally computed from the representation of their labels. With significantly fewer parameters and hyperparameters an instance of EP is competitive with and often outperforms state of the art unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods on a range of benchmark data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Supervision for Continual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13321v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of continual learning, models are designed to learn tasks one after the other. While most research has centered on supervised continual learning, there is a growing interest in unsupervised continual learning, which makes use of the vast amounts of unlabeled data. Recent studies have highlighted the strengths of unsupervised methods, particularly self-supervised learning, in providing robust representations. The improved transferability of those representations built with self-supervised methods is often associated with the role played by the multi-layer perceptron projector. In this work, we depart from this observation and reexamine the role of supervision in continual representation learning. We reckon that additional information, such as human annotations, should not deteriorate the quality of representations. Our findings show that supervised models when enhanced with a multi-layer perceptron head, can outperform self-supervised models in continual representation learning. This highlights the importance of the multi-layer perceptron projector in shaping feature transferability across a sequence of tasks in continual learning.

| **[Hierarchically Clustered Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09906v2)** | 2019-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The joint optimization of representation learning and clustering in the embedding space has experienced a breakthrough in recent years. In spite of the advance, clustering with representation learning has been limited to flat-level categories, which often involves cohesive clustering with a focus on instance relations. To overcome the limitations of flat clustering, we introduce hierarchically-clustered representation learning (HCRL), which simultaneously optimizes representation learning and hierarchical clustering in the embedding space. Compared with a few prior works, HCRL firstly attempts to consider a generation of deep embeddings from every component of the hierarchy, not just leaf components. In addition to obtaining hierarchically clustered embeddings, we can reconstruct data by the various abstraction levels, infer the intrinsic hierarchical structure, and learn the level-proportion features. We conducted evaluations with image and text domains, and our quantitative analyses showed competent likelihoods and the best accuracies compared with the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, Under review as a conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Robustness as a Prior for Learned Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00945v2)** | 2019-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important goal in deep learning is to learn versatile, high-level feature representations of input data. However, standard networks' representations seem to possess shortcomings that, as we illustrate, prevent them from fully realizing this goal. In this work, we show that robust optimization can be re-cast as a tool for enforcing priors on the features learned by deep neural networks. It turns out that representations learned by robust models address the aforementioned shortcomings and make significant progress towards learning a high-level encoding of inputs. In particular, these representations are approximately invertible, while allowing for direct visualization and manipulation of salient input features. More broadly, our results indicate adversarial robustness as a promising avenue for improving learned representations. Our code and models for reproducing these results is available at https://git.io/robust-reps .</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning of Pretext-Invariant Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01991v1)** | 2019-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of self-supervised learning from images is to construct image representations that are semantically meaningful via pretext tasks that do not require semantic annotations for a large training set of images. Many pretext tasks lead to representations that are covariant with image transformations. We argue that, instead, semantic representations ought to be invariant under such transformations. Specifically, we develop Pretext-Invariant Representation Learning (PIRL, pronounced as "pearl") that learns invariant representations based on pretext tasks. We use PIRL with a commonly used pretext task that involves solving jigsaw puzzles. We find that PIRL substantially improves the semantic quality of the learned image representations. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in self-supervised learning from images on several popular benchmarks for self-supervised learning. Despite being unsupervised, PIRL outperforms supervised pre-training in learning image representations for object detection. Altogether, our results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning of image representations with good invariance properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Learning via Learning the Representation, Provably](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.09434v2)** | 2021-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies few-shot learning via representation learning, where one uses $T$ source tasks with $n_1$ data per task to learn a representation in order to reduce the sample complexity of a target task for which there is only $n_2 (\ll n_1)$ data. Specifically, we focus on the setting where there exists a good \emph{common representation} between source and target, and our goal is to understand how much of a sample size reduction is possible. First, we study the setting where this common representation is low-dimensional and provide a fast rate of $O\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}\left(Φ\right)}{n_1T} + \frac{k}{n_2}\right)$; here, $Φ$ is the representation function class, $\mathcal{C}\left(Φ\right)$ is its complexity measure, and $k$ is the dimension of the representation. When specialized to linear representation functions, this rate becomes $O\left(\frac{dk}{n_1T} + \frac{k}{n_2}\right)$ where $d (\gg k)$ is the ambient input dimension, which is a substantial improvement over the rate without using representation learning, i.e. over the rate of $O\left(\frac{d}{n_2}\right)$. This result bypasses the $Ω(\frac{1}{T})$ barrier under the i.i.d. task assumption, and can capture the desired property that all $n_1T$ samples from source tasks can be \emph{pooled} together for representation learning. Next, we consider the setting where the common representation may be high-dimensional but is capacity-constrained (say in norm); here, we again demonstrate the advantage of representation learning in both high-dimensional linear regression and neural network learning. Our results demonstrate representation learning can fully utilize all $n_1T$ samples from source tasks.</p></details> | ICLR2021 |

Since the emergence of AlexNet every winning submission of the ImageNet challenge has employed end-to-end representation learning, and due to the utility of good representations for transfer learning, representation learning has become as an important and distinct task from supervised learning. At present, this distinction is inconsequential, as supervised methods are state-of-the-art in learning transferable representations. But recent work has shown that generative models can also be powerful agents of representation learning. Will the representations learned from these generative methods ever rival the quality of those from their supervised competitors? In this work, we argue in the affirmative, that from an information theoretic perspective, generative models have greater potential for representation learning. Based on several experimentally validated assumptions, we show that supervised learning is upper bounded in its capacity for representation learning in ways that certain generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are not. We hope that our analysis will provide a rigorous motivation for further exploration of generative representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2017 Workshop Track</p></details> |

Recently, many methods have used a wide variety of types of approaches for learning meaningful state representations in reinforcement learning, allowing better sample efficiency, generalization, and performance. This survey aims to provide a broad categorization of these methods within a model-free online setting, exploring how they tackle the learning of state representations differently. We categorize the methods into six main classes, detailing their mechanisms, benefits, and limitations. Through this taxonomy, our aim is to enhance the understanding of this field and provide a guide for new researchers. We also discuss techniques for assessing the quality of representations, and detail relevant future directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Representations Outperform Online Continually Learned Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08823v3)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning has primarily focused on the issue of catastrophic forgetting and the associated stability-plasticity tradeoffs. However, little attention has been paid to the efficacy of continually learned representations, as representations are learned alongside classifiers throughout the learning process. Our primary contribution is empirically demonstrating that existing online continually trained deep networks produce inferior representations compared to a simple pre-defined random transforms. Our approach projects raw pixels using a fixed random transform, approximating an RBF-Kernel initialized before any data is seen. We then train a simple linear classifier on top without storing any exemplars, processing one sample at a time in an online continual learning setting. This method, called RanDumb, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art continually learned representations across all standard online continual learning benchmarks. Our study reveals the significant limitations of representation learning, particularly in low-exemplar and online continual learning scenarios. Extending our investigation to popular exemplar-free scenarios with pretrained models, we find that training only a linear classifier on top of pretrained representations surpasses most continual fine-tuning and prompt-tuning strategies. Overall, our investigation challenges the prevailing assumptions about effective representation learning in online continual learning.

Our approach, BigBiGAN, builds upon the state-of-the-art BigGAN model, extending it to representation learning by adding an encoder and modifying the discriminator. We extensively evaluate the representation learning and generation capabilities of these BigBiGAN models, demonstrating that these generation-based models achieve the state of the art in unsupervised representation learning on ImageNet, as well as in unconditional image generation.

| **[Learning Invariant Representation for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06162v1)** | 2021-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning aims to provide intelligent agents that are capable of learning continually a sequence of tasks, building on previously learned knowledge. A key challenge in this learning paradigm is catastrophically forgetting previously learned tasks when the agent faces a new one. Current rehearsal-based methods show their success in mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem by replaying samples from previous tasks during learning a new one. However, these methods are infeasible when the data of previous tasks is not accessible. In this work, we propose a new pseudo-rehearsal-based method, named learning Invariant Representation for Continual Learning (IRCL), in which class-invariant representation is disentangled from a conditional generative model and jointly used with class-specific representation to learn the sequential tasks. Disentangling the shared invariant representation helps to learn continually a sequence of tasks, while being more robust to forgetting and having better knowledge transfer. We focus on class incremental learning where there is no knowledge about task identity during inference. We empirically evaluate our proposed method on two well-known benchmarks for continual learning: split MNIST and split Fashion MNIST. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms regularization-based methods by a big margin and is better than the state-of-the-art pseudo-rehearsal-based method. Finally, we analyze the role of the shared invariant representation in mitigating the forgetting problem especially when the number of replayed samples for each previous task is small.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI Meta-Learning for Computer Vision Workshop (2021)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Representational Disparities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17533v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a fair machine learning algorithm to model interpretable differences between observed and desired human decision-making, with the latter aimed at reducing disparity in a downstream outcome impacted by the human decision. Prior work learns fair representations without considering the outcome in the decision-making process. We model the outcome disparities as arising due to the different representations of the input seen by the observed and desired decision-maker, which we term representational disparities. Our goal is to learn interpretable representational disparities which could potentially be corrected by specific nudges to the human decision, mitigating disparities in the downstream outcome; we frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem using a neural network. Under reasonable simplifying assumptions, we prove that our neural network model of the representational disparity learns interpretable weights that fully mitigate the outcome disparity. We validate objectives and interpret results using real-world German Credit, Adult, and Heritage Health datasets.</p></details> | 27 pages |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning with Relation Awareness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11122v2)** | 2022-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning on heterogeneous graphs aims to obtain meaningful node representations to facilitate various downstream tasks, such as node classification and link prediction. Existing heterogeneous graph learning methods are primarily developed by following the propagation mechanism of node representations. There are few efforts on studying the role of relations for improving the learning of more fine-grained node representations. Indeed, it is important to collaboratively learn the semantic representations of relations and discern node representations with respect to different relation types. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, namely R-HGNN, to learn node representations on heterogeneous graphs at a fine-grained level by considering relation-aware characteristics. Specifically, a dedicated graph convolution component is first designed to learn unique node representations from each relation-specific graph separately. Then, a cross-relation message passing module is developed to improve the interactions of node representations across different relations. Also, the relation representations are learned in a layer-wise manner to capture relation semantics, which are used to guide the node representation learning process. Moreover, a semantic fusing module is presented to aggregate relation-aware node representations into a compact representation with the learned relation representations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a variety of graph learning tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods among all the tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the TKDE journal</p></details> |

Empirical evidence has revealed that representation learning plays a crucial role in endowing humans with such a capability. Inspired by this observation, we study representation learning in the sequential decision-making scenario with contextual changes. We propose an online algorithm that is able to learn and transfer context-dependent representations and show that it significantly outperforms the existing ones that do not learn representations adaptively. As a case study, we apply our algorithm to the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, a well-established test for the mental flexibility of humans in sequential decision-making. By comparing our algorithm with the standard Q-learning and Deep-Q learning algorithms, we demonstrate the benefits of adaptive representation learning.</p></details> | 3 Figures |
| **[Language-Driven Representation Learning for Robotics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12766v1)** | 2023-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in visual representation learning for robotics demonstrates the viability of learning from large video datasets of humans performing everyday tasks. Leveraging methods such as masked autoencoding and contrastive learning, these representations exhibit strong transfer to policy learning for visuomotor control. But, robot learning encompasses a diverse set of problems beyond control including grasp affordance prediction, language-conditioned imitation learning, and intent scoring for human-robot collaboration, amongst others. First, we demonstrate that existing representations yield inconsistent results across these tasks: masked autoencoding approaches pick up on low-level spatial features at the cost of high-level semantics, while contrastive learning approaches capture the opposite. We then introduce Voltron, a framework for language-driven representation learning from human videos and associated captions. Voltron trades off language-conditioned visual reconstruction to learn low-level visual patterns, and visually-grounded language generation to encode high-level semantics. We also construct a new evaluation suite spanning five distinct robot learning problems $\unicode{x2013}$ a unified platform for holistically evaluating visual representations for robotics. Through comprehensive, controlled experiments across all five problems, we find that Voltron's language-driven representations outperform the prior state-of-the-art, especially on targeted problems requiring higher-level features.</p></details> | 30 Pages, 15 Figures |
| **[Fair Sufficient Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01030v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The main objective of fair statistical modeling and machine learning is to minimize or eliminate biases that may arise from the data or the model itself, ensuring that predictions and decisions are not unjustly influenced by sensitive attributes such as race, gender, age, or other protected characteristics. In this paper, we introduce a Fair Sufficient Representation Learning (FSRL) method that balances sufficiency and fairness. Sufficiency ensures that the representation should capture all necessary information about the target variables, while fairness requires that the learned representation remains independent of sensitive attributes. FSRL is based on a convex combination of an objective function for learning a sufficient representation and an objective function that ensures fairness. Our approach manages fairness and sufficiency at the representation level, offering a novel perspective on fair representation learning. We implement this method using distance covariance, which is effective for characterizing independence between random variables. We establish the convergence properties of the learned representations. Experiments conducted on healthcase and text datasets with diverse structures demonstrate that FSRL achieves a superior trade-off between fairness and accuracy compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 11 figures, and 6 tables (1 in the main text, 5 in the appendix)</p></details> |
| **[On the Complexity of Representation Learning in Contextual Linear Bandits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09429v1)** | 2022-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contextual linear bandits, the reward function is assumed to be a linear combination of an unknown reward vector and a given embedding of context-arm pairs. In practice, the embedding is often learned at the same time as the reward vector, thus leading to an online representation learning problem. Existing approaches to representation learning in contextual bandits are either very generic (e.g., model-selection techniques or algorithms for learning with arbitrary function classes) or specialized to particular structures (e.g., nested features or representations with certain spectral properties). As a result, the understanding of the cost of representation learning in contextual linear bandit is still limited. In this paper, we take a systematic approach to the problem and provide a comprehensive study through an instance-dependent perspective. We show that representation learning is fundamentally more complex than linear bandits (i.e., learning with a given representation). In particular, learning with a given set of representations is never simpler than learning with the worst realizable representation in the set, while we show cases where it can be arbitrarily harder. We complement this result with an extensive discussion of how it relates to existing literature and we illustrate positive instances where representation learning is as complex as learning with a fixed representation and where sub-logarithmic regret is achievable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Fair and Transferable Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10673v3)** | 2020-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing learning methods which do not discriminate subgroups in the population is a central goal of algorithmic fairness. One way to reach this goal is by modifying the data representation in order to meet certain fairness constraints. In this work we measure fairness according to demographic parity. This requires the probability of the possible model decisions to be independent of the sensitive information. We argue that the goal of imposing demographic parity can be substantially facilitated within a multitask learning setting. We leverage task similarities by encouraging a shared fair representation across the tasks via low rank matrix factorization. We derive learning bounds establishing that the learned representation transfers well to novel tasks both in terms of prediction performance and fairness metrics. We present experiments on three real world datasets, showing that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Representation Learning for Gaze Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13404v1)** | 2022-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become prevalent for learning representations in computer vision. Notably, SSL exploits contrastive learning to encourage visual representations to be invariant under various image transformations. The task of gaze estimation, on the other hand, demands not just invariance to various appearances but also equivariance to the geometric transformations. In this work, we propose a simple contrastive representation learning framework for gaze estimation, named Gaze Contrastive Learning (GazeCLR). GazeCLR exploits multi-view data to promote equivariance and relies on selected data augmentation techniques that do not alter gaze directions for invariance learning. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GazeCLR for several settings of the gaze estimation task. Particularly, our results show that GazeCLR improves the performance of cross-domain gaze estimation and yields as high as 17.2% relative improvement. Moreover, the GazeCLR framework is competitive with state-of-the-art representation learning methods for few-shot evaluation.

While the data are often ambiguous, high-dimensional, and complex to interpret, many dynamical systems can be effectively described by a low-dimensional set of state variables. Discovering these state variables from the data is a crucial aspect for (i) improving the data efficiency, robustness, and generalization of DRL methods, (ii) tackling the curse of dimensionality, and (iii) bringing interpretability and insights into black-box DRL. This review provides a comprehensive and complete overview of unsupervised representation learning in DRL by describing the main Deep Learning tools used for learning representations of the world, providing a systematic view of the method and principles, summarizing applications, benchmarks and evaluation strategies, and discussing open challenges and future directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Model Semantics in Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03649v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to architecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability, alignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments, we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled design of robust learning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Unsupervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08982v1)** | 2020-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To leverage enormous unlabeled data on distributed edge devices, we formulate a new problem in federated learning called Federated Unsupervised Representation Learning (FURL) to learn a common representation model without supervision while preserving data privacy. FURL poses two new challenges: (1) data distribution shift (Non-IID distribution) among clients would make local models focus on different categories, leading to the inconsistency of representation spaces. (2) without the unified information among clients in FURL, the representations across clients would be misaligned. To address these challenges, we propose Federated Constrastive Averaging with dictionary and alignment (FedCA) algorithm. FedCA is composed of two key modules: (1) dictionary module to aggregate the representations of samples from each client and share with all clients for consistency of representation space and (2) alignment module to align the representation of each client on a base model trained on a public data. We adopt the contrastive loss for local model training. Through extensive experiments with three evaluation protocols in IID and Non-IID settings, we demonstrate that FedCA outperforms all baselines with significant margins.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Disentangled Discrete Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14151v1)** | 2023-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent successes in image generation, model-based reinforcement learning, and text-to-image generation have demonstrated the empirical advantages of discrete latent representations, although the reasons behind their benefits remain unclear. We explore the relationship between discrete latent spaces and disentangled representations by replacing the standard Gaussian variational autoencoder (VAE) with a tailored categorical variational autoencoder. We show that the underlying grid structure of categorical distributions mitigates the problem of rotational invariance associated with multivariate Gaussian distributions, acting as an efficient inductive prior for disentangled representations. We provide both analytical and empirical findings that demonstrate the advantages of discrete VAEs for learning disentangled representations. Furthermore, we introduce the first unsupervised model selection strategy that favors disentangled representations.</p></details> |  |

We consider the limitations of proto-value functions (PVFs) at accurately approximating the value function in low dimensions and we highlight the importance of features learning for an improved low-dimensional value function approximation. Then, we adopt different representation learning algorithm on graphs to learn the basis functions that best represent the value function. We empirically show that node2vec, an algorithm for scalable feature learning in networks, and the Variational Graph Auto-Encoder constantly outperform the commonly used smooth proto-value functions in low-dimensional feature space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning State Representations via Retracing in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12600v2)** | 2022-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose learning via retracing, a novel self-supervised approach for learning the state representation (and the associated dynamics model) for reinforcement learning tasks. In addition to the predictive (reconstruction) supervision in the forward direction, we propose to include "retraced" transitions for representation / model learning, by enforcing the cycle-consistency constraint between the original and retraced states, hence improve upon the sample efficiency of learning. Moreover, learning via retracing explicitly propagates information about future transitions backward for inferring previous states, thus facilitates stronger representation learning for the downstream reinforcement learning tasks. We introduce Cycle-Consistency World Model (CCWM), a concrete model-based instantiation of learning via retracing. Additionally we propose a novel adaptive "truncation" mechanism for counteracting the negative impacts brought by "irreversible" transitions such that learning via retracing can be maximally effective. Through extensive empirical studies on visual-based continuous control benchmarks, we demonstrate that CCWM achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of sample efficiency and asymptotic performance, whilst exhibiting behaviours that are indicative of stronger representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Shared Representations in Multi-task Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02041v1)** | 2016-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a paradigm in multi-task reinforcement learning (MT-RL) in which an agent is placed in an environment and needs to learn to perform a series of tasks, within this space. Since the environment does not change, there is potentially a lot of common ground amongst tasks and learning to solve them individually seems extremely wasteful. In this paper, we explicitly model and learn this shared structure as it arises in the state-action value space. We will show how one can jointly learn optimal value-functions by modifying the popular Value-Iteration and Policy-Iteration procedures to accommodate this shared representation assumption and leverage the power of multi-task supervised learning. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed model and training procedures, are able to infer good value functions, even under low samples regimes. In addition to data efficiency, we will show in our analysis, that learning abstractions of the state space jointly across tasks leads to more robust, transferable representations with the potential for better generalization. this shared representation assumption and leverage the power of multi-task supervised learning. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed model and training procedures, are able to infer good value functions, even under low samples regimes. In addition to data efficiency, we will show in our analysis, that learning abstractions of the state space jointly across tasks leads to more robust, transferable representations with the potential for better generalization.</p></details> |  |

| **[Rotation and Translation Invariant Representation Learning with Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13995v2)** | 2023-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many computer vision applications, images are acquired with arbitrary or random rotations and translations, and in such setups, it is desirable to obtain semantic representations disentangled from the image orientation. Examples of such applications include semiconductor wafer defect inspection, plankton microscope images, and inference on single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) micro-graphs. In this work, we propose Invariant Representation Learning with Implicit Neural Representation (IRL-INR), which uses an implicit neural representation (INR) with a hypernetwork to obtain semantic representations disentangled from the orientation of the image. We show that IRL-INR can effectively learn disentangled semantic representations on more complex images compared to those considered in prior works and show that these semantic representations synergize well with SCAN to produce state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering results.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Learning Contrastive Representations for Learning with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01785v3)** | 2022-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are able to memorize noisy labels easily with a softmax cross-entropy (CE) loss. Previous studies attempted to address this issue focus on incorporating a noise-robust loss function to the CE loss. However, the memorization issue is alleviated but still remains due to the non-robust CE loss. To address this issue, we focus on learning robust contrastive representations of data on which the classifier is hard to memorize the label noise under the CE loss. We propose a novel contrastive regularization function to learn such representations over noisy data where label noise does not dominate the representation learning. By theoretically investigating the representations induced by the proposed regularization function, we reveal that the learned representations keep information related to true labels and discard information related to corrupted labels. Moreover, our theoretical results also indicate that the learned representations are robust to the label noise. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated with experiments on benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proper Laplacian Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10833v2)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to learn good representations of states is essential for solving large reinforcement learning problems, where exploration, generalization, and transfer are particularly challenging. The Laplacian representation is a promising approach to address these problems by inducing informative state encoding and intrinsic rewards for temporally-extended action discovery and reward shaping. To obtain the Laplacian representation one needs to compute the eigensystem of the graph Laplacian, which is often approximated through optimization objectives compatible with deep learning approaches. These approximations, however, depend on hyperparameters that are impossible to tune efficiently, converge to arbitrary rotations of the desired eigenvectors, and are unable to accurately recover the corresponding eigenvalues. In this paper we introduce a theoretically sound objective and corresponding optimization algorithm for approximating the Laplacian representation. Our approach naturally recovers both the true eigenvectors and eigenvalues while eliminating the hyperparameter dependence of previous approximations. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method and we show that those results translate empirically into robust learning across multiple environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Tensor Representations for Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07348v1)** | 2022-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a tensor-based model of shared representation for meta-learning from a diverse set of tasks. Prior works on learning linear representations for meta-learning assume that there is a common shared representation across different tasks, and do not consider the additional task-specific observable side information. In this work, we model the meta-parameter through an order-$3$ tensor, which can adapt to the observed task features of the task. We propose two methods to estimate the underlying tensor. The first method solves a tensor regression problem and works under natural assumptions on the data generating process. The second method uses the method of moments under additional distributional assumptions and has an improved sample complexity in terms of the number of tasks. We also focus on the meta-test phase, and consider estimating task-specific parameters on a new task. Substituting the estimated tensor from the first step allows us estimating the task-specific parameters with very few samples of the new task, thereby showing the benefits of learning tensor representations for meta-learning. Finally, through simulation and several real-world datasets, we evaluate our methods and show that it improves over previous linear models of shared representations for meta-learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forth...</summary><p>Forthcoming at AISTATS-2022</p></details> |
| **[State Representation Learning for Control: An Overview](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04181v2)** | 2018-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning algorithms are designed to learn abstract features that characterize data. State representation learning (SRL) focuses on a particular kind of representation learning where learned features are in low dimension, evolve through time, and are influenced by actions of an agent. The representation is learned to capture the variation in the environment generated by the agent's actions; this kind of representation is particularly suitable for robotics and control scenarios. In particular, the low dimension characteristic of the representation helps to overcome the curse of dimensionality, provides easier interpretation and utilization by humans and can help improve performance and speed in policy learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning. This survey aims at covering the state-of-the-art on state representation learning in the most recent years. It reviews different SRL methods that involve interaction with the environment, their implementations and their applications in robotics control tasks (simulated or real). In particular, it highlights how generic learning objectives are differently exploited in the reviewed algorithms. Finally, it discusses evaluation methods to assess the representation learned and summarizes current and future lines of research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning on Large and Small Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.09873v1)** | 2017-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning owes its success to three key factors: scale of data, enhanced models to learn representations from data, and scale of computation. This book chapter presented the importance of the data-driven approach to learn good representations from both big data and small data. In terms of big data, it has been widely accepted in the research community that the more data the better for both representation and classification improvement. The question is then how to learn representations from big data, and how to perform representation learning when data is scarce. We addressed the first question by presenting CNN model enhancements in the aspects of representation, optimization, and generalization. To address the small data challenge, we showed transfer representation learning to be effective. Transfer representation learning transfers the learned representation from a source domain where abundant training data is available to a target domain where training data is scarce. Transfer representation learning gave the OM and melanoma diagnosis modules of our XPRIZE Tricorder device (which finished $2^{nd}$ out of $310$ competing teams) a significant boost in diagnosis accuracy.</p></details> | Book chapter |
| **[Provable Meta-Learning of Linear Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11684v5)** | 2022-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, seeks to design algorithms that can utilize previous experience to rapidly learn new skills or adapt to new environments. Representation learning -- a key tool for performing meta-learning -- learns a data representation that can transfer knowledge across multiple tasks, which is essential in regimes where data is scarce. Despite a recent surge of interest in the practice of meta-learning, the theoretical underpinnings of meta-learning algorithms are lacking, especially in the context of learning transferable representations. In this paper, we focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression -- in which multiple linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. Here, we provide provably fast, sample-efficient algorithms to address the dual challenges of (1) learning a common set of features from multiple, related tasks, and (2) transferring this knowledge to new, unseen tasks. Both are central to the general problem of meta-learning. Finally, we complement these results by providing information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample complexity of learning these linear features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Lower...</summary><p>Lower bound slightly improved to include task diversity parameter</p></details> |
| **[Representation Learning by Ranking across multiple tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15093v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, representation learning has become the research focus of the machine learning community. Large-scale neural networks are a crucial step toward achieving general intelligence, with their success largely attributed to their ability to learn abstract representations of data. Several learning fields are actively discussing how to learn representations, yet there is a lack of a unified perspective. We convert the representation learning problem under different tasks into a ranking problem. By adopting the ranking problem as a unified perspective, representation learning tasks can be solved in a unified manner by optimizing the ranking loss. Experiments under various learning tasks, such as classification, retrieval, multi-label learning, and regression, prove the superiority of the representation learning by ranking framework. Furthermore, experiments under self-supervised learning tasks demonstrate the significant advantage of the ranking framework in processing unsupervised training data, with data augmentation techniques further enhancing its performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stackelberg Coupling of Online Representation Learning and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07452v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Q-learning jointly learns representations and values within monolithic networks, promising beneficial co-adaptation between features and value estimates. Although this architecture has attained substantial success, the coupling between representation and value learning creates instability as representations must constantly adapt to non-stationary value targets, while value estimates depend on these shifting representations. This is compounded by high variance in bootstrapped targets, which causes bias in value estimation in off-policy methods. We introduce Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER), a framework for value-based RL that views representation and Q-learning as two strategic agents in a hierarchical game. SCORER models the Q-function as the leader, which commits to its strategy by updating less frequently, while the perception network (encoder) acts as the follower, adapting more frequently to learn representations that minimize Bellman error variance given the leader's committed strategy. Through this division of labor, the Q-function minimizes MSBE while perception minimizes its variance, thereby reducing bias accordingly, with asymmetric updates allowing stable co-adaptation, unlike simultaneous parameter updates in monolithic solutions. Our proposed SCORER framework leads to a bi-level optimization problem whose solution is approximated by a two-timescale algorithm that creates an asymmetric learning dynamic between the two players. Extensive experiments on DQN and its variants demonstrate that gains stem from algorithmic insight rather than model complexity.</p></details> |  |

While previously limited to predicting missing parts of an input, we explore how to generalize the JEPA prediction task to a broader set of corruptions. We introduce Image World Models, an approach that goes beyond masked image modeling and learns to predict the effect of global photometric transformations in latent space. We study the recipe of learning performant IWMs and show that it relies on three key aspects: conditioning, prediction difficulty, and capacity. Additionally, we show that the predictive world model learned by IWM can be adapted through finetuning to solve diverse tasks; a fine-tuned IWM world model matches or surpasses the performance of previous self-supervised methods. Finally, we show that learning with an IWM allows one to control the abstraction level of the learned representations, learning invariant representations such as contrastive methods, or equivariant representations such as masked image modelling.</p></details> | 23 pages, 16 figures |
| **[DeepWalk: Online Learning of Social Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6652v2)** | 2014-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present DeepWalk, a novel approach for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide $F_1$ scores up to 10% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

In this study, to extend the technique of unsupervised learning to the speech domain, we propose the Momentum Contrast for VoxCeleb (MoCoVox) as a form of learning mechanism. We pre-trained the MoCoVox on the VoxCeleb1 by implementing instance discrimination. Applying MoCoVox for speaker verification revealed that it outperforms the state-of-the-art metric learning-based approach by a large margin. We also empirically demonstrate the features of contrastive learning in the speech domain by analyzing the distribution of learned representations. Furthermore, we explored which pretext task is adequate for speaker verification. We expect that learning speaker representation without human supervision helps to address the open-set speaker recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scale-invariant representation of machine learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02914v2)** | 2022-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of machine learning has resulted from its structured representation of data. Similar data have close internal representations as compressed codes for classification or emerged labels for clustering. We observe that the frequency of internal codes or labels follows power laws in both supervised and unsupervised learning models. This scale-invariant distribution implies that machine learning largely compresses frequent typical data, and simultaneously, differentiates many atypical data as outliers. In this study, we derive the process by which these power laws can naturally arise in machine learning. In terms of information theory, the scale-invariant representation corresponds to a maximally uncertain data grouping among possible representations that guarantee a given learning accuracy.</p></details> |  |

We propose the Code BERT (CoBERT) approach for self-supervised speech representation learning. The idea is to convert an utterance to a sequence of discrete codes, and perform code representation learning, where we predict the code representations based on a masked view of the original speech input. Unlike the prior self-distillation approaches of which the teacher and the student are of the same modality, our target model predicts representations from a different modality. CoBERT outperforms the most recent state-of-the-art performance on the ASR task and brings significant improvements on the SUPERB speech translation (ST) task.

| **[Information Competing Process for Learning Diversified Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01288v3)** | 2019-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning representations with diversified information remains as an open problem. Towards learning diversified representations, a new approach, termed Information Competing Process (ICP), is proposed in this paper. Aiming to enrich the information carried by feature representations, ICP separates a representation into two parts with different mutual information constraints. The separated parts are forced to accomplish the downstream task independently in a competitive environment which prevents the two parts from learning what each other learned for the downstream task. Such competing parts are then combined synergistically to complete the task. By fusing representation parts learned competitively under different conditions, ICP facilitates obtaining diversified representations which contain rich information. Experiments on image classification and image reconstruction tasks demonstrate the great potential of ICP to learn discriminative and disentangled representations in both supervised and self-supervised learning settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept as a NeurIPS 2019 paper</p></details> |

We address this need through our proposed approach, RELAX, which is the first approach for attribution-based explanations of representations. Our approach can also model the uncertainty in its explanations, which is essential to produce trustworthy explanations. RELAX explains representations by measuring similarities in the representation space between an input and masked out versions of itself, providing intuitive explanations and significantly outperforming the gradient-based baseline. We provide theoretical interpretations of RELAX and conduct a novel analysis of feature extractors trained using supervised and unsupervised learning, providing insights into different learning strategies. Finally, we illustrate the usability of RELAX in multi-view clustering and highlight that incorporating uncertainty can be essential for providing low-complexity explanations, taking a crucial step towards explaining representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Edge Representation Learning with Hypergraphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15845v2)** | 2021-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have recently achieved remarkable success in representing graph-structured data, with rapid progress in both the node embedding and graph pooling methods. Yet, they mostly focus on capturing information from the nodes considering their connectivity, and not much work has been done in representing the edges, which are essential components of a graph. However, for tasks such as graph reconstruction and generation, as well as graph classification tasks for which the edges are important for discrimination, accurately representing edges of a given graph is crucial to the success of the graph representation learning. To this end, we propose a novel edge representation learning framework based on Dual Hypergraph Transformation (DHT), which transforms the edges of a graph into the nodes of a hypergraph. This dual hypergraph construction allows us to apply message-passing techniques for node representations to edges. After obtaining edge representations from the hypergraphs, we then cluster or drop edges to obtain holistic graph-level edge representations. We validate our edge representation learning method with hypergraphs on diverse graph datasets for graph representation and generation performance, on which our method largely outperforms existing graph representation learning methods. Moreover, our edge representation learning and pooling method also largely outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification, not only because of its accurate edge representation learning, but also due to its lossless compression of the nodes and removal of irrelevant edges for effective message-passing.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2021 |
| **[On the Importance of Feature Decorrelation for Unsupervised Representation Learning in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05637v1)** | 2023-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, unsupervised representation learning (URL) has improved the sample efficiency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) by pretraining a model from a large unlabeled dataset. The underlying principle of these methods is to learn temporally predictive representations by predicting future states in the latent space. However, an important challenge of this approach is the representational collapse, where the subspace of the latent representations collapses into a low-dimensional manifold. To address this issue, we propose a novel URL framework that causally predicts future states while increasing the dimension of the latent manifold by decorrelating the features in the latent space. Through extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate that our framework effectively learns predictive representations without collapse, which significantly improves the sample efficiency of state-of-the-art URL methods on the Atari 100k benchmark.

| **[Partitioning Image Representation in Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.10454v3)** | 2022-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contrastive learning in the image domain, the anchor and positive samples are forced to have as close representations as possible. However, forcing the two samples to have the same representation could be misleading because the data augmentation techniques make the two samples different. In this paper, we introduce a new representation, partitioned representation, which can learn both common and unique features of the anchor and positive samples in contrastive learning. The partitioned representation consists of two parts: the content part and the style part. The content part represents common features of the class, and the style part represents the own features of each sample, which can lead to the representation of the data augmentation method. We can achieve the partitioned representation simply by decomposing a loss function of contrastive learning into two terms on the two separate representations, respectively. To evaluate our representation with two parts, we take two framework models: Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and BootstrapYour Own Latent(BYOL) to show the separability of content and style, and to confirm the generalization ability in classification, respectively. Based on the experiments, we show that our approach can separate two types of information in the VAE framework and outperforms the conventional BYOL in linear separability and a few-shot learning task as downstream tasks.</p></details> | 7 pages |

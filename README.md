| **[Collaborative Diffusion Model for Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18997v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based recommender systems (DR) have gained increasing attention for their advanced generative and denoising capabilities. However, existing DR face two central limitations: (i) a trade-off between enhancing generative capacity via noise injection and retaining the loss of personalized information. (ii) the underutilization of rich item-side information. To address these challenges, we present a Collaborative Diffusion model for Recommender System (CDiff4Rec). Specifically, CDiff4Rec generates pseudo-users from item features and leverages collaborative signals from both real and pseudo personalized neighbors identified through behavioral similarity, thereby effectively reconstructing nuanced user preferences. Experimental results on three public datasets show that CDiff4Rec outperforms competitors by effectively mitigating the loss of personalized information through the integration of item content and collaborative signals.</p></details> | WWW'25 short |
| **[A Survey on Diffusion Models for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05033v2)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While traditional recommendation techniques have made significant strides in the past decades, they still suffer from limited generalization performance caused by factors like inadequate collaborative signals, weak latent representations, and noisy data. In response, diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as promising solutions for recommender systems due to their robust generative capabilities, solid theoretical foundations, and improved training stability. To this end, in this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey on diffusion models for recommendation, and draw a bird's-eye view from the perspective of the whole pipeline in real-world recommender systems. We systematically categorize existing research works into three primary domains: (1) diffusion for data engineering & encoding, focusing on data augmentation and representation enhancement; (2) diffusion as recommender models, employing diffusion models to directly estimate user preferences and rank items; and (3) diffusion for content presentation, utilizing diffusion models to generate personalized content such as fashion and advertisement creatives. Our taxonomy highlights the unique strengths of diffusion models in capturing complex data distributions and generating high-quality, diverse samples that closely align with user preferences. We also summarize the core characteristics of the adapting diffusion models for recommendation, and further identify key areas for future exploration, which helps establish a roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to advance recommender systems through the innovative application of diffusion models. To further facilitate the research community of recommender systems based on diffusion models, we actively maintain a GitHub repository for papers and other related resources in this rising direction https://github.com/CHIANGEL/Awesome-Diffusion-for-RecSys.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[DiffMM: Multi-Modal Diffusion Model for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11781v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of online multi-modal sharing platforms like TikTok and YouTube has enabled personalized recommender systems to incorporate multiple modalities (such as visual, textual, and acoustic) into user representations. However, addressing the challenge of data sparsity in these systems remains a key issue. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced self-supervised learning techniques to enhance recommender systems. However, these methods often rely on simplistic random augmentation or intuitive cross-view information, which can introduce irrelevant noise and fail to accurately align the multi-modal context with user-item interaction modeling. To fill this research gap, we propose a novel multi-modal graph diffusion model for recommendation called DiffMM. Our framework integrates a modality-aware graph diffusion model with a cross-modal contrastive learning paradigm to improve modality-aware user representation learning. This integration facilitates better alignment between multi-modal feature information and collaborative relation modeling. Our approach leverages diffusion models' generative capabilities to automatically generate a user-item graph that is aware of different modalities, facilitating the incorporation of useful multi-modal knowledge in modeling user-item interactions. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, consistently demonstrating the superiority of our DiffMM over various competitive baselines. For open-sourced model implementation details, you can access the source codes of our proposed framework at: https://github.com/HKUDS/DiffMM .</p></details> |  |
| **[Plug-in Diffusion Model for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02913v1)** | 2024-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pioneering efforts have verified the effectiveness of the diffusion models in exploring the informative uncertainty for recommendation. Considering the difference between recommendation and image synthesis tasks, existing methods have undertaken tailored refinements to the diffusion and reverse process. However, these approaches typically use the highest-score item in corpus for user interest prediction, leading to the ignorance of the user's generalized preference contained within other items, thereby remaining constrained by the data sparsity issue. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel Plug-in Diffusion Model for Recommendation (PDRec) framework, which employs the diffusion model as a flexible plugin to jointly take full advantage of the diffusion-generating user preferences on all items. Specifically, PDRec first infers the users' dynamic preferences on all items via a time-interval diffusion model and proposes a Historical Behavior Reweighting (HBR) mechanism to identify the high-quality behaviors and suppress noisy behaviors. In addition to the observed items, PDRec proposes a Diffusion-based Positive Augmentation (DPA) strategy to leverage the top-ranked unobserved items as the potential positive samples, bringing in informative and diverse soft signals to alleviate data sparsity. To alleviate the false negative sampling issue, PDRec employs Noise-free Negative Sampling (NNS) to select stable negative samples for ensuring effective model optimization. Extensive experiments and analyses on four datasets have verified the superiority of the proposed PDRec over the state-of-the-art baselines and showcased the universality of PDRec as a flexible plugin for commonly-used sequential encoders in different recommendation scenarios. The code is available in https://github.com/hulkima/PDRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[DiffKG: Knowledge Graph Diffusion Model for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16890v1)** | 2023-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have emerged as invaluable resources for enriching recommendation systems by providing a wealth of factual information and capturing semantic relationships among items. Leveraging KGs can significantly enhance recommendation performance. However, not all relations within a KG are equally relevant or beneficial for the target recommendation task. In fact, certain item-entity connections may introduce noise or lack informative value, thus potentially misleading our understanding of user preferences. To bridge this research gap, we propose a novel knowledge graph diffusion model for recommendation, referred to as DiffKG. Our framework integrates a generative diffusion model with a data augmentation paradigm, enabling robust knowledge graph representation learning. This integration facilitates a better alignment between knowledge-aware item semantics and collaborative relation modeling. Moreover, we introduce a collaborative knowledge graph convolution mechanism that incorporates collaborative signals reflecting user-item interaction patterns, guiding the knowledge graph diffusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, consistently demonstrating the superiority of our DiffKG compared to various competitive baselines. We provide the source code repository of our proposed DiffKG model at the following link: https://github.com/HKUDS/DiffKG.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by WSDM'2024 Oral</p></details> |
| **[RecFusion: A Binomial Diffusion Process for 1D Data for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08947v3)** | 2023-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we propose RecFusion, which comprise a set of diffusion models for recommendation. Unlike image data which contain spatial correlations, a user-item interaction matrix, commonly utilized in recommendation, lacks spatial relationships between users and items. We formulate diffusion on a 1D vector and propose binomial diffusion, which explicitly models binary user-item interactions with a Bernoulli process. We show that RecFusion approaches the performance of complex VAE baselines on the core recommendation setting (top-n recommendation for binary non-sequential feedback) and the most common datasets (MovieLens and Netflix). Our proposed diffusion models that are specialized for 1D and/or binary setups have implications beyond recommendation systems, such as in the medical domain with MRI and CT scans.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/gabriben/recfusion</p></details> |

| **[SpatialThinker: Reinforcing 3D Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs via Spatial Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07403v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks, but they continue to struggle with spatial understanding. Existing spatial MLLMs often rely on explicit 3D inputs or architecture-specific modifications, and remain constrained by large-scale datasets or sparse supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce SpatialThinker, a 3D-aware MLLM trained with RL to integrate structured spatial grounding with multi-step reasoning. The model simulates human-like spatial perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards. SpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline that generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL with a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding. SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o. These results showcase the effectiveness of combining spatial supervision with reward-aligned reasoning in enabling robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and advancing MLLMs towards human-level visual reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Mixed Signals: Understanding Model Disagreement in Multimodal Empathy Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13979v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models play a key role in empathy detection, but their performance can suffer when modalities provide conflicting cues. To understand these failures, we examine cases where unimodal and multimodal predictions diverge. Using fine-tuned models for text, audio, and video, along with a gated fusion model, we find that such disagreements often reflect underlying ambiguity, as evidenced by annotator uncertainty. Our analysis shows that dominant signals in one modality can mislead fusion when unsupported by others. We also observe that humans, like models, do not consistently benefit from multimodal input. These insights position disagreement as a useful diagnostic signal for identifying challenging examples and improving empathy system robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[JPRO: Automated Multimodal Jailbreaking via Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07315v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread application of large VLMs makes ensuring their secure deployment critical. While recent studies have demonstrated jailbreak attacks on VLMs, existing approaches are limited: they require either white-box access, restricting practicality, or rely on manually crafted patterns, leading to poor sample diversity and scalability. To address these gaps, we propose JPRO, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework designed for automated VLM jailbreaking. It effectively overcomes the shortcomings of prior methods in attack diversity and scalability. Through the coordinated action of four specialized agents and its two core modules: Tactic-Driven Seed Generation and Adaptive Optimization Loop, JPRO generates effective and diverse attack samples. Experimental results show that JPRO achieves over a 60\% attack success rate on multiple advanced VLMs, including GPT-4o, significantly outperforming existing methods. As a black-box attack approach, JPRO not only uncovers critical security vulnerabilities in multimodal models but also offers valuable insights for evaluating and enhancing VLM robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAMP-VQA: Caption-Embedded Multimodal Perception for No-Reference Quality Assessment of Compressed Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07290v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevalence of user-generated content (UGC) on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok has rendered no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment (VQA) vital for optimizing video delivery. Nonetheless, the characteristics of non-professional acquisition and the subsequent transcoding of UGC video on sharing platforms present significant challenges for NR-VQA. Although NR-VQA models attempt to infer mean opinion scores (MOS), their modeling of subjective scores for compressed content remains limited due to the absence of fine-grained perceptual annotations of artifact types. To address these challenges, we propose CAMP-VQA, a novel NR-VQA framework that exploits the semantic understanding capabilities of large vision-language models. Our approach introduces a quality-aware prompting mechanism that integrates video metadata (e.g., resolution, frame rate, bitrate) with key fragments extracted from inter-frame variations to guide the BLIP-2 pretraining approach in generating fine-grained quality captions. A unified architecture has been designed to model perceptual quality across three dimensions: semantic alignment, temporal characteristics, and spatial characteristics. These multimodal features are extracted and fused, then regressed to video quality scores. Extensive experiments on a wide variety of UGC datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing NR-VQA methods, achieving improved accuracy without the need for costly manual fine-grained annotations. Our method achieves the best performance in terms of average rank and linear correlation (SRCC: 0.928, PLCC: 0.938) compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code and trained models, along with a user-friendly demo, are available at: https://github.com/xinyiW915/CAMP-VQA.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[RobustA: Robust Anomaly Detection in Multimodal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07276v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, multimodal anomaly detection methods have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements over video-only models. However, real-world multimodal data is often corrupted due to unforeseen environmental distortions. In this paper, we present the first-of-its-kind work that comprehensively investigates the adverse effects of corrupted modalities on multimodal anomaly detection task. To streamline this work, we propose RobustA, a carefully curated evaluation dataset to systematically observe the impacts of audio and visual corruptions on the overall effectiveness of anomaly detection systems. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal anomaly detection method, which shows notable resilience against corrupted modalities. The proposed method learns a shared representation space for different modalities and employs a dynamic weighting scheme during inference based on the estimated level of corruption. Our work represents a significant step forward in enabling the real-world application of multimodal anomaly detection, addressing situations where the likely events of modality corruptions occur. The proposed evaluation dataset with corrupted modalities and respective extracted features will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> |
| **[MVU-Eval: Towards Multi-Video Understanding Evaluation for Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07250v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded AI capabilities to visual modalities, yet existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-video understanding, overlooking the critical need for multi-video understanding in real-world scenarios (e.g., sports analytics and autonomous driving). To address this significant gap, we introduce MVU-Eval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multi-Video Understanding for MLLMs. Specifically, our MVU-Eval mainly assesses eight core competencies through 1,824 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 4,959 videos from diverse domains, addressing both fundamental perception tasks and high-order reasoning tasks. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with real-world applications such as multi-sensor synthesis in autonomous systems and cross-angle sports analytics. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we reveal significant performance discrepancies and limitations in current MLLMs' ability to perform understanding across multiple videos. The benchmark will be made publicly available to foster future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepEyesV2: Toward Agentic Multimodal Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05271v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation. We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding, mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2 exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://visual-agent.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Wasm: A Pipeline for Constructing Structured Arabic Interleaved Multimodal Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07080v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) depends heavily on the quality and scale of their pre-training datasets. Recent research shows that large multimodal models trained on natural documents where images and text are interleaved outperform those trained only on image-text pairs across a wide range of benchmarks, leveraging advanced pre- trained models to enforce semantic alignment, image-sequence consistency, and textual coherence. For Arabic, however, the lack of high-quality multimodal datasets that preserve document structure has limited progress. In this paper, we present our pipeline Wasm for processing the Common Crawl dataset to create a new Arabic multimodal dataset that uniquely provides markdown output. Unlike existing Arabic corpora that focus solely on text extraction, our approach preserves the structural integrity of web content while maintaining flexibility for both text-only and multimodal pre-training scenarios. We provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of our data processing pipeline against those used for major existing datasets, highlighting the convergences in filtering strategies and justifying our specific design choices. To support future research, we publicly release a representative dataset dump along with the multimodal processing pipeline for Arabic.</p></details> |  |

We participate in the text-only translation tasks for English-Hindi, English-Bengali, English-Malayalam, and English-Odia language pairs. We present a two-stage approach that addresses quality issues in the training data through automated error detection and correction, followed by parameter-efficient model fine-tuning. Our methodology introduces a vision-augmented judge-corrector pipeline that leverages multimodal language models to systematically identify and correct translation errors in the training data. The judge component classifies translations into three categories: correct, visually ambiguous (requiring image context), or mistranslated (poor translation quality). Identified errors are routed to specialized correctors: GPT-4o-mini regenerates captions requiring visual disambiguation, while IndicTrans2 retranslates cases with pure translation quality issues. This automated pipeline processes 28,928 training examples across four languages, correcting an average of 17.1% of captions per language. We then apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the IndicTrans2 en-indic 200M distilled model on both original and corrected datasets. Training on corrected data yields consistent improvements, with BLEU score gains of +1.30 for English-Bengali on the evaluation set (42.00 -> 43.30) and +0.70 on the challenge set (44.90 -> 45.60), +0.60 for English-Odia on the evaluation set (41.00 -> 41.60), and +0.10 for English-Hindi on the challenge set (53.90 -> 54.00).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 12th Workshop on Asian Translation, co-located with IJCLNLP-AACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[HCFSLN: Adaptive Hyperbolic Few-Shot Learning for Multimodal Anxiety Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06988v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anxiety disorders impact millions globally, yet traditional diagnosis relies on clinical interviews, while machine learning models struggle with overfitting due to limited data. Large-scale data collection remains costly and time-consuming, restricting accessibility. To address this, we introduce the Hyperbolic Curvature Few-Shot Learning Network (HCFSLN), a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) framework for multimodal anxiety detection, integrating speech, physiological signals, and video data. HCFSLN enhances feature separability through hyperbolic embeddings, cross-modal attention, and an adaptive gating network, enabling robust classification with minimal data. We collected a multimodal anxiety dataset from 108 participants and benchmarked HCFSLN against six FSL baselines, achieving 88% accuracy, outperforming the best baseline by 14%. These results highlight the effectiveness of hyperbolic space for modeling anxiety-related speech patterns and demonstrate FSL's potential for anxiety classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[RPTS: Tree-Structured Reasoning Process Scoring for Faithful Multimodal Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06899v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in multimodal reasoning and have shown impressive performance on various multimodal benchmarks. However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process. We evaluated representative LVLMs (e.g., GPT4o, Llava-Next), uncovering their limitations in multimodal reasoning and highlighting the differences between open-source and closed-source commercial LVLMs. We believe that this benchmark will contribute to the advancement of research in the field of multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMPACT: Behavioral Intention-aware Multimodal Trajectory Prediction with Adaptive Context Trimming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09103v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most prior research has focused on improving the precision of multimodal trajectory predictions, the explicit modeling of multimodal behavioral intentions (e.g., yielding, overtaking) remains relatively underexplored. This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |
| **[HydraInfer: Hybrid Disaggregated Scheduling for Multimodal Large Language Model Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12658v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been rapidly advancing, enabling cross-modal understanding and generation, and propelling artificial intelligence towards artificial general intelligence. However, existing MLLM inference systems are typically designed based on the architecture of language models, integrating image processing and language processing as a single scheduling unit. This design struggles to accommodate the heterogeneous demands of different stages in terms of computational resources, memory access patterns, and service-level objectives (SLOs), leading to low resource utilization and high request latency, ultimately failing to meet the service requirements of diverse inference scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose HydraInfer, an efficient MLLM inference system that adopts a Hybrid Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) Disaggregation architecture. By scheduling the three stages - encode, prefill, and decode - onto separate heterogeneous inference instances, the system flexibly reallocates resources across stages, significantly reducing idle computation, alleviating resource bottlenecks, and improving overall system throughput and scalability. In addition, HydraInfer supports a stage-level batching strategy that enhances load balancing, enables parallel execution of visual and language models, and further optimizes inference performance. Experiments under real multimodal inference workloads demonstrate that HydraInfer can achieve up to 4x higher inference throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems (e.g., vLLM) on a single-node 8xH800 GPU cluster, while meeting the 90th percentile request SLO.</p></details> |  |
| **[MathSE: Improving Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning via Self-Evolving Iterative Reflection and Reward-Guided Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06805v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language answering tasks. Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{\method}, a \textbf{Math}ematical \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM). To verify the effectiveness of \method, we evaluate it on a suite of challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over backbone models. Notably, our experimental results on MathVL-test surpass the leading open-source multimodal mathematical reasoning model QVQ. Our code and models are available at \texttt{https://zheny2751\allowbreak-dotcom.github.io/\allowbreak MathSE.github.io/}.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Cross-Modal Unlearning via Influential Neuron Path Editing in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06793v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) extend foundation models to real-world applications by integrating inputs such as text and vision. However, their broad knowledge capacity raises growing concerns about privacy leakage, toxicity mitigation, and intellectual property violations. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a practical solution by selectively forgetting targeted knowledge while preserving overall model utility. When applied to MLLMs, existing neuron-editing-based MU approaches face two fundamental challenges: (1) forgetting becomes inconsistent across modalities because existing point-wise attribution methods fail to capture the structured, layer-by-layer information flow that connects different modalities; and (2) general knowledge performance declines when sensitive neurons that also support important reasoning paths are pruned, as this disrupts the model's ability to generalize. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a multimodal influential neuron path editor (MIP-Editor) for MU. Our approach introduces modality-specific attribution scores to identify influential neuron paths responsible for encoding forget-set knowledge and applies influential-path-aware neuron-editing via representation misdirection. This strategy also enables effective and coordinated forgetting across modalities while preserving the model's general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MIP-Editor achieves a superior unlearning performance on multimodal tasks, with a maximum forgetting rate of 87.75% and up to 54.26% improvement in general knowledge retention. On textual tasks, MIP-Editor achieves up to 80.65% forgetting and preserves 77.9% of general performance.

| **[Enhancing Multimodal Recommendations with Vision-Language Models and Information-Aware Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02113v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal recommendation (MMR) highlight the potential of integrating visual and textual content to enrich item representations. However, existing methods often rely on coarse visual features and naive fusion strategies, resulting in redundant or misaligned representations. From an information-theoretic perspective, effective fusion should balance unique, shared, and redundant modality information to preserve complementary cues. To this end, we propose VIRAL, a novel Vision-Language and Information-aware Recommendation framework that enhances multimodal fusion through two components: (i) a VLM-based visual enrichment module that generates fine-grained, title-guided descriptions for semantically aligned image representations, and (ii) an information-aware fusion module inspired by Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to disentangle and integrate complementary signals. Experiments on three Amazon datasets show that VIRAL consistently outperforms strong multimodal baselines and substantially improves the contribution of visual features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting the Data Sampling in Multimodal Post-training from a Difficulty-Distinguish View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06722v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have spurred significant progress in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Building on the success of Deepseek-R1, researchers extended multimodal reasoning to post-training paradigms based on reinforcement learning (RL), focusing predominantly on mathematical datasets. However, existing post-training paradigms tend to neglect two critical aspects: (1) The lack of quantifiable difficulty metrics capable of strategically screening samples for post-training optimization. (2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose two novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation, while Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction complexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we design a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate consistent superiority of GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples compared to conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines, indicating that strategic data sampling can obviate the need for supervised fine-tuning while improving model accuracy.

However, it is crucial for patients that models can provide explainable diagnoses along with medical segmentation results. In this paper, we introduce a medical vision-language task named Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (MDS), which aims to understand clinical queries for medical images and generate the corresponding segmentation masks as well as diagnostic results. To facilitate this task, we first present the Multimodal Multi-disease Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (M3DS) dataset, containing diverse multimodal multi-disease medical images paired with their corresponding segmentation masks and diagnosis chain-of-thought, created via an automated diagnosis chain-of-thought generation pipeline. Moreover, we propose Sim4Seg, a novel framework that improves the performance of diagnosis segmentation by taking advantage of the Region-Aware Vision-Language Similarity to Mask (RVLS2M) module. To improve overall performance, we investigate a test-time scaling strategy for MDS tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines in both segmentation and diagnosis.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[Aligning Brain Signals with Multimodal Speech and Vision Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00065v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When we hear the word "house", we don't just process sound, we imagine walls, doors, memories. The brain builds meaning through layers, moving from raw acoustics to rich, multimodal associations. Inspired by this, we build on recent work from Meta that aligned EEG signals with averaged wav2vec2 speech embeddings, and ask a deeper question: which layers of pre-trained models best reflect this layered processing in the brain? We compare embeddings from two models: wav2vec2, which encodes sound into language, and CLIP, which maps words to images. Using EEG recorded during natural speech perception, we evaluate how these embeddings align with brain activity using ridge regression and contrastive decoding. We test three strategies: individual layers, progressive concatenation, and progressive summation. The findings suggest that combining multimodal, layer-aware representations may bring us closer to decoding how the brain understands language, not just as sound, but as experience.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce HumaniBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 32,000 real-world image-question pairs and an accompanying evaluation suite. Using a semi-automated annotation pipeline, each sample is rigorously validated by domain experts to ensure accuracy and ethical integrity. HumaniBench assesses LMMs across seven key alignment principles: fairness, ethics, empathy, inclusivity, reasoning, robustness, and multilinguality through a diverse set of open- and closed-ended VQA tasks. Grounded in AI ethics theory and real-world social contexts, these principles provide a holistic lens for examining human-aligned behavior. Benchmarking results reveal distinct behavioral patterns: certain model families excel in reasoning, fairness, and multilinguality, while others demonstrate greater robustness and grounding capability. However, most models still struggle to balance task accuracy with ethical and inclusive responses. Techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting and test-time scaling yield measurable alignment gains. As the first benchmark explicitly designed for HC evaluation, HumaniBench offers a rigorous testbed to diagnose limitations, quantify alignment trade-offs, and promote the responsible development of large multimodal models. All data and code are publicly released to ensure transparency and reproducibility. https://vectorinstitute.github.io/HumaniBench/</p></details> |  |
| **[SportR: A Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Model Reasoning in Sports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06499v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deeply understanding sports requires an intricate blend of fine-grained visual perception and rule-based reasoning - a challenge that pushes the limits of current multimodal models. To succeed, models must master three critical capabilities: perceiving nuanced visual details, applying abstract sport rule knowledge, and grounding that knowledge in specific visual evidence. Current sports benchmarks either cover single sports or lack the detailed reasoning chains and precise visual grounding needed to robustly evaluate these core capabilities in a multi-sport context. To address this gap, we introduce SportR, the first multi-sports large-scale benchmark designed to train and evaluate MLLMs on the fundamental reasoning required for sports intelligence. Our benchmark provides a dataset of 5,017 images and 2,101 videos. To enable granular evaluation, we structure our benchmark around a progressive hierarchy of question-answer (QA) pairs designed to probe reasoning at increasing depths - from simple infraction identification to complex penalty prediction. For the most advanced tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, such as determining penalties or explaining tactics, we provide 7,118 high-quality, human-authored Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations. In addition, our benchmark incorporates both image and video modalities and provides manual bounding box annotations to test visual grounding in the image part directly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the profound difficulty of our benchmark. State-of-the-art baseline models perform poorly on our most challenging tasks. While training on our data via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning improves these scores, they remain relatively low, highlighting a significant gap in current model capabilities. SportR presents a new challenge for the community, providing a critical resource to drive future research in multimodal sports reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[MULTIBENCH++: A Unified and Comprehensive Multimodal Fusion Benchmarking Across Specialized Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06452v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although multimodal fusion has made significant progress, its advancement is severely hindered by the lack of adequate evaluation benchmarks. Current fusion methods are typically evaluated on a small selection of public datasets, a limited scope that inadequately represents the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios, potentially leading to biased evaluations. This issue presents a twofold challenge. On one hand, models may overfit to the biases of specific datasets, hindering their generalization to broader practical applications. On the other hand, the absence of a unified evaluation standard makes fair and objective comparisons between different fusion methods difficult. Consequently, a truly universal and high-performance fusion model has yet to emerge. To address these challenges, we have developed a large-scale, domain-adaptive benchmark for multimodal evaluation. This benchmark integrates over 30 datasets, encompassing 15 modalities and 20 predictive tasks across key application domains. To complement this, we have also developed an open-source, unified, and automated evaluation pipeline that includes standardized implementations of state-of-the-art models and diverse fusion paradigms. Leveraging this platform, we have conducted large-scale experiments, successfully establishing new performance baselines across multiple tasks. This work provides the academic community with a crucial platform for rigorous and reproducible assessment of multimodal models, aiming to propel the field of multimodal artificial intelligence to new heights.</p></details> |  |

Conversely, smaller open-source models offer cost advantages but struggle with complex or multimodal queries. We introduce a unified, modular framework that intelligently routes each query - textual, multimodal, or complex - to the most fitting expert model, using a learned routing network that balances cost and quality. For vision tasks, we employ a two-stage open-source pipeline optimized for efficiency and reviving efficient classical vision components where they remain SOTA for sub-tasks. On benchmarks such as Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) and Visual Question Answering (VQA), we match or exceed the performance of always-premium LLM (monolithic systems with one model serving all query types) performance, yet reduce the reliance on costly models by over 67%. With its extensible, multi-agent orchestration, we deliver high-quality, resource-efficient AI at scale.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

Using a dataset of 271,700 products from 40 international fashion e-commerce platforms, we integrate textual features (RoBERTa), visual features (ViT), and joint vision-language representations (CLIP). We investigate fusion strategies, including early, late, and attention-based fusion within a hierarchical architecture enhanced by dynamic masking to ensure taxonomic consistency. Results show that CLIP embeddings combined via an MLP-based late-fusion strategy achieve the highest hierarchical F1 (98.59%), outperforming unimodal baselines. To address shallow or inconsistent categories, we further introduce a self-supervised "product recategorization" pipeline using SimCLR, UMAP, and cascade clustering, which discovered new, fine-grained categories (for example, subtypes of "Shoes") with cluster purities above 86%. Cross-platform experiments reveal a deployment-relevant trade-off: complex late-fusion methods maximize accuracy with diverse training data, while simpler early-fusion methods generalize more effectively to unseen platforms. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's industrial scalability through deployment in EURWEB's commercial transaction intelligence platform via a two-stage inference pipeline, combining a lightweight RoBERTa stage with a GPU-accelerated multimodal stage to balance cost and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accet...</summary><p>Accetped at IEEE BigData 2025, 10 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving Multimodal Sentiment Analysis via Modality Optimization and Dynamic Primary Modality Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06328v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to predict sentiment from language, acoustic, and visual data in videos. However, imbalanced unimodal performance often leads to suboptimal fused representations. Existing approaches typically adopt fixed primary modality strategies to maximize dominant modality advantages, yet fail to adapt to dynamic variations in modality importance across different samples. Moreover, non-language modalities suffer from sequential redundancy and noise, degrading model performance when they serve as primary inputs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a modality optimization and dynamic primary modality selection framework (MODS). First, a Graph-based Dynamic Sequence Compressor (GDC) is constructed, which employs capsule networks and graph convolution to reduce sequential redundancy in acoustic/visual modalities. Then, we develop a sample-adaptive Primary Modality Selector (MSelector) for dynamic dominance determination. Finally, a Primary-modality-Centric Cross-Attention (PCCA) module is designed to enhance dominant modalities while facilitating cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance by effectively balancing modality contributions and eliminating redundant noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, by observing the MMD posts, we hold that the text modality may be much more informative than the image modality because the text generally describes the whole event/story of the current post but the image often presents partial scenes only. Our preliminary empirical results indicate that the image modality exactly contributes less to MMD. Upon this idea, we propose a new MMD method named RETSIMD. Specifically, we suppose that each text can be divided into several segments, and each text segment describes a partial scene that can be presented by an image. Accordingly, we split the text into a sequence of segments, and feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images. We further incorporate two auxiliary objectives concerning text-image and image-label mutual information, and further post-train the generator over an auxiliary text-to-image generation benchmark dataset. Additionally, we propose a graph structure by defining three heuristic relationships between images, and use a graph neural network to generate the fused features. Extensive empirical results validate the effectiveness of RETSIMD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026. 13 pages, 6 figures.

| **[SkinCaRe: A Multimodal Dermatology Dataset Annotated with Medical Caption and Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18004v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL) and vision large language models (VLLMs), in skin disease diagnosis, the need for interpretability becomes crucial. However, existing dermatology datasets are limited in their inclusion of concept-level meta-labels, and none offer rich medical descriptions in natural language. This deficiency impedes the advancement of LLM-based methods in dermatologic diagnosis. To address this gap and provide a meticulously annotated dermatology dataset with comprehensive natural language descriptions, we introduce \textbf{SkinCaRe}, a comprehensive multimodal resource that unifies \textit{SkinCAP} and \textit{SkinCoT}. \textbf{SkinCAP} comprises 4,000 images sourced from the Fitzpatrick 17k skin disease dataset and the Diverse Dermatology Images dataset, annotated by board-certified dermatologists to provide extensive medical descriptions and captions. In addition, we introduce \textbf{SkinCoT}, a curated dataset pairing 3,041 dermatologic images with clinician-verified, hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT) diagnoses. Each diagnostic narrative is rigorously evaluated against six quality criteria and iteratively refined until it meets a predefined standard of clinical accuracy and explanatory depth. Together, SkinCAP (captioning) and SkinCoT (reasoning), collectively referred to as SkinCaRe, encompass 7,041 expertly curated dermatologic cases and provide a unified and trustworthy resource for training multimodal models that both describe and explain dermatologic images. SkinCaRe is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/yuhos16/SkinCaRe.</p></details> |  |

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive 2D image reasoning segmentation, adapting these capabilities to 3D scenes remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-For3D, a simple yet effective framework that transfers knowledge from 2D MLLMs to 3D scene understanding. Specifically, we utilize MLLMs to generate multi-view pseudo segmentation masks and corresponding text embeddings, then unproject 2D masks into 3D space and align them with the text embeddings. The primary challenge lies in the absence of 3D context and spatial consistency across multiple views, causing the model to hallucinate objects that do not exist and fail to target objects consistently. Training the 3D model with such irrelevant objects leads to performance degradation. To address this, we introduce a spatial consistency strategy to enforce that segmentation masks remain coherent in the 3D space, effectively capturing the geometry of the scene. Moreover, we develop a Token-for-Query approach for multimodal semantic alignment, enabling consistent identification of the same object across different views. Extensive evaluations on various challenging indoor scene benchmarks demonstrate that, even without any labeled 3D training data, MLLM-For3D outperforms existing 3D reasoning segmentation methods, effectively interpreting user intent, understanding 3D scenes, and reasoning about spatial relationships.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[ReMoD: Rethinking Modality Contribution in Multimodal Stance Detection via Dual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06057v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Stance Detection (MSD) is a crucial task for understanding public opinion on social media. Existing work simply fuses information from various modalities to learn stance representations, overlooking the varying contributions of stance expression from different modalities. Therefore, stance misunderstanding noises may be drawn into the stance learning process due to the risk of learning errors by rough modality combination. To address this, we get inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition and propose **ReMoD**, a framework that **Re**thinks **Mo**dality contribution of stance expression through a **D**ual-reasoning paradigm. ReMoD integrates *experience-driven intuitive reasoning* to capture initial stance cues with *deliberate reflective reasoning* to adjust for modality biases, refine stance judgments, and thereby dynamically weight modality contributions based on their actual expressive power for the target stance. Specifically, the intuitive stage queries the Modality Experience Pool (MEP) and Semantic Experience Pool (SEP) to form an initial stance hypothesis, prioritizing historically impactful modalities. This hypothesis is then refined in the reflective stage via two reasoning chains: Modality-CoT updates MEP with adaptive fusion strategies to amplify relevant modalities, while Semantic-CoT refines SEP with deeper contextual insights of stance semantics. These dual experience structures are continuously refined during training and recalled at inference to guide robust and context-aware stance decisions. Extensive experiments on the public MMSD benchmark demonstrate that our ReMoD significantly outperforms most baseline models and exhibits strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Yet, despite its growing importance for environmental sensing as well as the advance of joint communication and sensing for prospective WiFi and 6G standards, a dataset that integrates these modalities with radio frequency data (radar and RFID) remains rare. We introduce RF-Behavior, a multimodal radio frequency dataset for comprehensive human behavior and emotion analysis. We collected data from 44 participants performing 21 gestures, 10 activities, and 6 sentiment expressions. Data were captured using synchronized sensors, including 13 radars (8 ground-mounted and 5 ceiling-mounted), 6 to 8 RFID tags (attached to each arm) and LoRa. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) and 24 infrared cameras are used to provide precise motion ground truth. RF-Behavior provides a unified multimodal dataset spanning the full spectrum of human behavior -- from brief gestures to activities and emotional states -- enabling research on multi-task learning across motion and emotion recognition. Benchmark results demonstrate that the strategic sensor placement is complementary across modalities, with distinct performance characteristics across different behavioral categories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Commonality in Few: Few-Shot Multimodal Anomaly Detection via Hypergraph-Enhanced Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05966v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot multimodal industrial anomaly detection is a critical yet underexplored task, offering the ability to quickly adapt to complex industrial scenarios. In few-shot settings, insufficient training samples often fail to cover the diverse patterns present in test samples. This challenge can be mitigated by extracting structural commonality from a small number of training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection method based on structural commonality, CIF (Commonality In Few). To extract intra-class structural information, we employ hypergraphs, which are capable of modeling higher-order correlations, to capture the structural commonality within training samples, and use a memory bank to store this intra-class structural prior. Firstly, we design a semantic-aware hypergraph construction module tailored for single-semantic industrial images, from which we extract common structures to guide the construction of the memory bank. Secondly, we use a training-free hypergraph message passing module to update the visual features of test samples, reducing the distribution gap between test features and features in the memory bank. We further propose a hyperedge-guided memory search module, which utilizes structural information to assist the memory search process and reduce the false positive rate. Experimental results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and the Eyecandies dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in few-shot settings.

Speeder introduces 3 key components: (1) Multimodal Representation Compression (MRC), which efficiently reduces redundancy in item descriptions; (2) Sequential Position Awareness Enhancement (SPAE), which strengthens the model's ability to capture complex sequential dependencies; (3) Modality-aware Progressive Optimization (MPO), which progressively integrates different modalities to improve the model's understanding and reduce cognitive biases. Through extensive experiments, Speeder demonstrates superior performance over baselines in terms of VHR@1 and computational efficiency. Specifically, Speeder achieved 250% of the training speed and 400% of the inference speed compared to the state-of-the-art MLLM-based SR models. Future work could focus on incorporating real-time feedback from real-world systems.</p></details> |  |

While previous research has quantified bias at the dataset level or manually identified spurious correlations between modalities and labels, these approaches lack meaningful insights at the sample level and struggle to scale to the vast amount of online information. In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level. Specifically, we propose three bias quantification methods based on theories/views of different levels of granularity: 1) a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit; 2) a medium-grained quantification of information flow; and 3) a fine-grained causality analysis. To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks. Experimental results reveal three interesting findings that provide potential direction toward future research: 1)~Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; 2)~Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; and 3)~Different views produce a higher agreement on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.</p></details> |  |

While generative AI (GenAI) chatbots are increasingly used for idea generation, designers often struggle to craft effective prompts and find it difficult to express evolving visual concepts through text alone. In the formative study (N=6), we examined how designers use GenAI during ideation, revealing that text-based prompting disrupts creative flow. To address these issues, we developed TalkSketch, an embedded multimodal AI sketching system that integrates freehand drawing with real-time speech input. TalkSketch aims to support a more fluid ideation process through capturing verbal descriptions during sketching and generating context-aware AI responses. Our work highlights the potential of GenAI tools to engage the design process itself rather than focusing on output.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 Workshop on Creative AI for Live Interactive Performances (CLIP).

Existing models can contextualize content but often fail to infer the underlying intent within a reference image or scene, leading to inconsistent or misaligned edits. We introduce the Editing Vision-Language Model (EVLM), a system that interprets ambiguous instructions in conjunction with reference visuals to produce precise, context-aware editing prompts. EVLM's key innovation is a reflective reasoning framework that translates subjective user intent into structured, actionable outputs by aligning with human-rated rationales through Reflection-Aware KL-Divergence Target Optimization (RKTO). By combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with RKTO alignment, EVLM captures fine-grained editing preferences without relying on binary supervision. Trained on a dataset of 30,000 CoT examples with human-annotated rationale quality, EVLM achieves substantial gains in alignment with human intent. Experiments across image, video, 3D, and 4D editing tasks show that EVLM generates coherent and high-quality instructions, providing a scalable foundation for multimodal editing and reasoning.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Distributionally Robust Multimodal Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05716v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of distributionally robust multimodal machine learning. Existing approaches often rely on merging modalities on the feature level (early fusion) or heuristic uncertainty modeling, which downplays modality-aware ef- fects and provide limited insights. We propose a novel distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework that aims to study both the theoretical and practical insights of multimodal machine learning. We first justify this setup and show the significance of this problem through complexity analysis. We then establish both generalization upper bounds and minimax lower bounds which provide perfor- mance guarantees. These results are further extended in settings where we consider encoder-specific error propogations. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach improves robustness in both simulation settings and real-world datasets. Together, these findings provide a principled foundation for employing multimodal machine learning models in high-stakes applications where uncertainty is unavoidable.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce TRACE, a hierarchical multimodal framework that leverages visually grounded context augmentation, along with a novel caption-scoring network to emphasize hate-relevant content, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of CLIP's text encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that selectively fine-tuning deeper text encoder layers significantly enhances performance compared to simpler projection-layer fine-tuning methods. Specifically, our framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (0.807) and F1-score (0.806) on the widely-used Hateful Memes dataset, matching the performance of considerably larger models while maintaining efficiency. Moreover, it achieves superior generalization on the MultiOFF offensive meme dataset (F1-score 0.673), highlighting robustness across meme categories. Additional analyses confirm that robust visual grounding and nuanced text representations significantly reduce errors caused by benign confounders. We publicly release our code to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Special Track on AI for Social Impact (AISI) at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, over the last three decades, this view has changed considerably. Numerous studies have aimed to model and understand the architecture of the bilingual word recognition system Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), investigating how parallel activation operates in the brain and how one language influences another Kroll et al. (2015). Increasingly, evidence suggests that multilinguals, individuals who speak three or more languages, can perform better than monolinguals in various linguistic and cognitive tasks, such as learning an additional language Abu-Rabia and Sanitsky (2010). This research proposal focuses on the study of the mental lexicon and how it may be structured in individuals who speak multiple languages. Building on the work of Stella et al. (2018), who investigated explosive learning in humans using a multiplex model of the mental lexicon, and the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework proposed by Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), the present study applies the same multilayer network principles introduced by Kivela et al. (2014). Our experimental design extends previous research by incorporating multimodality into the multiplex model, introducing an additional layer that connects visual inputs to their corresponding lexical representations across the multilingual layers of the mental lexicon. In this research, we aim to explore how a heritage language influences the acquisition of another language. Specifically, we ask: Does the presence of visual input in a translation task influence participants' proficiency and accuracy compared to text-only conditions?</p></details> |  |
| **[Turning Adversaries into Allies: Reversing Typographic Attacks for Multimodal E-Commerce Product Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05325v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal product retrieval systems in e-commerce platforms rely on effectively combining visual and textual signals to improve search relevance and user experience. However, vision-language models such as CLIP are vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading or irrelevant text embedded in images skews model predictions. In this work, we propose a novel method that reverses the logic of typographic attacks by rendering relevant textual content (e.g., titles, descriptions) directly onto product images to perform vision-text compression, thereby strengthening image-text alignment and boosting multimodal product retrieval performance. We evaluate our method on three vertical-specific e-commerce datasets (sneakers, handbags, and trading cards) using six state-of-the-art vision foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in unimodal and multimodal retrieval accuracy across categories and model families. Our findings suggest that visually rendering product metadata is a simple yet effective enhancement for zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce applications.</p></details> |  |

We design InterFeedback, an interactive framework, which can be applied to any LMM and dataset to assess this ability autonomously. On top of this, we introduce InterFeedback-Bench which evaluates interactive intelligence using two representative datasets, MMMU-Pro and MathVerse, to test 10 different open-source LMMs. Additionally, we present InterFeedback-Human, a newly collected dataset of 120 cases designed for manually testing interactive performance in leading models such as OpenAI-o1 and Claude-Sonnet-4. Our evaluation results indicate that even the state-of-the-art LMM, OpenAI-o1, struggles to refine its responses based on human feedback, achieving an average score of less than 50%. Our findings point to the need for methods that can enhance LMMs' capabilities to interpret and benefit from feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[psiUnity: A Platform for Multimodal Data-Driven XR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05304v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extended reality (XR) research increasingly relies on the ability to stream and synchronize multimodal data between headsets and immersive applications for data-driven interaction and experimentation. However, developers face a critical gap: the Platform for Situated Intelligence (psi), which excels at deterministic temporal alignment and multimodal data management, has been largely inaccessible to the dominant Unity/MRTK ecosystem used for HoloLens development. We introduce psiUnity, an open-source C# integration that bridges psi's .NET libraries with Unity 2022.3 and MRTK3 for HoloLens 2. psiUnity enables bidirectional, real-time streaming of head pose, hand tracking, gaze, IMU, audio, and depth sensor data (AHAT and long-throw) with microsecond-level temporal precision, allowing Unity applications to both consume and produce synchronized multimodal data streams. By embedding psi's native serialization, logging, and temporal coordination directly within Unity's architecture, psiUnity extends psi beyond its previous StereoKit limitations and empowers the HRI, HCI, and embodied-AI communities to develop reproducible, data-driven XR interactions and experiments within the familiar Unity environment. The integration is available at https://github.com/sailgt/psiUnity.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMDocIR: Benchmarking Multimodal Retrieval for Long Documents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08828v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal document retrieval aims to identify and retrieve various forms of multimodal content, such as figures, tables, charts, and layout information from extensive documents. Despite its increasing popularity, there is a notable lack of a comprehensive and robust benchmark to effectively evaluate the performance of systems in such tasks. To address this gap, this work introduces a new benchmark, named MMDocIR, that encompasses two distinct tasks: page-level and layout-level retrieval. The former evaluates the performance of identifying the most relevant pages within a long document, while the later assesses the ability of detecting specific layouts, providing a more fine-grained measure than whole-page analysis. A layout refers to a variety of elements, including textual paragraphs, equations, figures, tables, or charts. The MMDocIR benchmark comprises a rich dataset featuring 1,685 questions annotated by experts and 173,843 questions with bootstrapped labels, making it a valuable resource in multimodal document retrieval for both training and evaluation. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that (i) visual retrievers significantly outperform their text counterparts, (ii) MMDocIR training set effectively enhances the performance of multimodal document retrieval and (iii) text retrievers leveraging VLM-text significantly outperforms retrievers relying on OCR-text. Our dataset is available at https://mmdocrag.github.io/MMDocIR/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to EMNLP-2025(Main)</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation for Document Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16470v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) faces dual challenges in processing lengthy multimodal documents (text, images, tables) and performing cross-modal reasoning. Current document retrieval-augmented generation (DocRAG) methods remain limited by their text-centric approaches, frequently missing critical visual information. The field also lacks robust benchmarks for assessing multimodal evidence selection and integration. We introduce MMDocRAG, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 4,055 expert-annotated QA pairs with multi-page, cross-modal evidence chains. Our framework introduces innovative metrics for evaluating multimodal quote selection and enables answers that interleave text with relevant visual elements. Through large-scale experiments with 60 VLM/LLM models and 14 retrieval systems, we identify persistent challenges in multimodal evidence retrieval, selection, and integration.Key findings reveal advanced proprietary LVMs show superior performance than open-sourced alternatives. Also, they show moderate advantages using multimodal inputs over text-only inputs, while open-source alternatives show significant performance degradation. Notably, fine-tuned LLMs achieve substantial improvements when using detailed image descriptions. MMDocRAG establishes a rigorous testing ground and provides actionable insights for developing more robust multimodal DocVQA systems. Our benchmark and code are available at https://mmdocrag.github.io/MMDocRAG/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to NeurIPS 2025 DB</p></details> |
| **[Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs on Spatial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13142v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. We thus propose EASI for holistic Evaluation of multimodAl LLMs on Spatial Intelligence. EASI conceptualizes a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a standardized protocol for the fair evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models. In this report, we conduct the study across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence (SI), yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail even the most advanced multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codeb...</summary><p>Codebase: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/EASI/</p></details> |

Predicting progression-free survival (PFS) could support individualized treatment planning. This study evaluates laboratory, imaging, and multimodal deep learning models for PFS prediction in PRRT-treated patients. In this retrospective, single-center study 116 patients with metastatic NETs undergoing 177Lu-DOTATOC were included. Clinical characteristics, laboratory values, and pretherapeutic somatostatin receptor positron emission tomography/computed tomographies (SR-PET/CT) were collected. Seven models were trained to classify low- vs. high-PFS groups, including unimodal (laboratory, SR-PET, or CT) and multimodal fusion approaches. Explainability was evaluated by feature importance analysis and gradient maps. Forty-two patients (36%) had short PFS (< 1 year), 74 patients long PFS (>1 year). Groups were similar in most characteristics, except for higher baseline chromogranin A (p = 0.003), elevated gamma-GT (p = 0.002), and fewer PRRT cycles (p < 0.001) in short-PFS patients. The Random Forest model trained only on laboratory biomarkers reached an AUROC of 0.59 +- 0.02. Unimodal three-dimensional convolutional neural networks using SR-PET or CT performed worse (AUROC 0.42 +- 0.03 and 0.54 +- 0.01, respectively). A multimodal fusion model laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT -augmented with a pretrained CT branch - achieved the best results (AUROC 0.72 +- 0.01, AUPRC 0.80 +- 0.01). Multimodal deep learning combining SR-PET, CT, and laboratory biomarkers outperformed unimodal approaches for PFS prediction after PRRT. Upon external validation, such models may support risk-adapted follow-up strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTPD: Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery for Enhanced Multimodal Electronic Health Records Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00696v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, such as numerical time series and free-text clinical reports, has great potential in predicting clinical outcomes. However, prior work has primarily focused on capturing temporal interactions within individual samples and fusing multimodal information, overlooking critical temporal patterns across patients. These patterns, such as trends in vital signs like abnormal heart rate or blood pressure, can indicate deteriorating health or an impending critical event. Similarly, clinical notes often contain textual descriptions that reflect these patterns. Identifying corresponding temporal patterns across different modalities is crucial for improving the accuracy of clinical outcome predictions, yet it remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce a Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery (CTPD) framework, designed to efficiently extract meaningful cross-modal temporal patterns from multimodal EHR data. Our approach introduces shared initial temporal pattern representations which are refined using slot attention to generate temporal semantic embeddings. To ensure rich cross-modal temporal semantics in the learned patterns, we introduce a contrastive-based TPNCE loss for cross-modal alignment, along with two reconstruction losses to retain core information of each modality. Evaluations on two clinically critical tasks, 48-hour in-hospital mortality and 24-hour phenotype classification, using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

This can help inform high-level search strategies, even when such images lack sufficient resolution for target recognition. However, many existing informative path planning or search-based approaches either assume no prior information, or use priors without accounting for how they were obtained. Recent work instead utilizes large Vision Language Models (VLMs) for generalizable priors, but their outputs can be inaccurate due to hallucination, leading to inefficient search. To address these challenges, we introduce Search-TTA, a multimodal test-time adaptation framework with a flexible plug-and-play interface compatible with various input modalities (e.g., image, text, sound) and planning methods (e.g., RL-based). First, we pretrain a satellite image encoder to align with CLIP's visual encoder to output probability distributions of target presence used for visual search. Second, our TTA framework dynamically refines CLIP's predictions during search using uncertainty-weighted gradient updates inspired by Spatial Poisson Point Processes. To train and evaluate Search-TTA, we curate AVS-Bench, a visual search dataset based on internet-scale ecological data containing 380k images and taxonomy data. We find that Search-TTA improves planner performance by up to 30.0%, particularly in cases with poor initial CLIP predictions due to domain mismatch and limited training data. It also performs comparably with significantly larger VLMs, and achieves zero-shot generalization via emergent alignment to unseen modalities. Finally, we deploy Search-TTA on a real UAV via hardware-in-the-loop testing, by simulating its operation within a large-scale simulation that provides onboard sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at CORL 2025.

| **[Exploring Multimodal Perception in Large Language Models Through Perceptual Strength Ratings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06980v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigated whether multimodal large language models can achieve human-like sensory grounding by examining their ability to capture perceptual strength ratings across sensory modalities. We explored how model characteristics (size, multimodal capabilities, architectural generation) influence grounding performance, distributional factor dependencies (word frequency, embeddings, feature distances), and human-model processing differences. We evaluated 21 models from four families (GPT, Gemini, LLaMA, Qwen) using 3,611 words from the Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms through correlation, distance metrics, and qualitative analysis. Results showed that larger (6 out of 8 comparisons), multimodal (5 of 7), and newer models (5 of 8) generally outperformed their smaller, text-based, and older counterparts. Top models achieved 85-90% accuracy and 0.58-0.65 correlations with human ratings, demonstrating substantial similarity. Moreover, distributional factors showed minimal impact, not exceeding human dependency levels. However, despite strong alignment, models were not identical to humans, as even top performers showed differences in distance and correlation measures, with qualitative analysis revealing processing patterns related to absent sensory grounding. Additionally, it remains questionable whether introducing multimodality resolves this grounding deficit. Although multimodality improved performance, it seems to provide similar information as massive text rather than qualitatively different data, as benefits occurred across unrelated sensory dimensions and massive text-only models achieved comparable results. Our findings demonstrate that while advanced LLMs can approximate human sensory-linguistic associations through statistical learning, they still differ from human embodied cognition in processing mechanisms, even with multimodal integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Fine-Tuning MedGemma for Clinical Captioning to Enhance Multimodal RAG over Malaysia CPGs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15418v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains, and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and follow-up notes. The data were collected under standard ethical guidelines and annotated for benchmarking. To demonstrate its utility, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art large vision-language models, Qwen-VL 3B and 7B, and evaluated them on two tasks: classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future research in AI dentistry.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Integrative Approach for Subtyping Mental Disorders Using Multimodal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04816v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the biological and behavioral heterogeneity underlying psychiatric disorders is critical for advancing precision diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. This paper addresses the scientific question of how multimodal data, spanning clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging measures, can be integrated to identify biologically meaningful subtypes of mental disorders. We introduce Mixed INtegrative Data Subtyping (MINDS), a Bayesian hierarchical model designed to jointly analyze mixed-type data for simultaneous dimension reduction and clustering. Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, MINDS integrates clinical symptoms, cognitive performance, and brain structure measures to subtype Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Our method leverages Polya-Gamma augmentation for computational efficiency and robust inference. Simulations demonstrate improved stability and accuracy compared to existing clustering approaches. Application to the ABCD data reveals clinically interpretable subtypes of ADHD and OCD with distinct cognitive and neurodevelopmental profiles. These findings show how integrative multimodal modeling can enhance the reproducibility and clinical relevance of psychiatric subtyping, supporting data-driven policies for early identification and targeted interventions in mental health.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Multimodal Diffusion Forcing for Forceful Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04812v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a dataset of expert trajectories, standard imitation learning approaches typically learn a direct mapping from observations (e.g., RGB images) to actions. However, such methods often overlook the rich interplay between different modalities, i.e., sensory inputs, actions, and rewards, which is crucial for modeling robot behavior and understanding task outcomes. In this work, we propose Multimodal Diffusion Forcing, a unified framework for learning from multimodal robot trajectories that extends beyond action generation. Rather than modeling a fixed distribution, MDF applies random partial masking and trains a diffusion model to reconstruct the trajectory. This training objective encourages the model to learn temporal and cross-modal dependencies, such as predicting the effects of actions on force signals or inferring states from partial observations. We evaluate MDF on contact-rich, forceful manipulation tasks in simulated and real-world environments. Our results show that MDF not only delivers versatile functionalities, but also achieves strong performance, and robustness under noisy observations.

However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1) Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration, we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks, Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU. Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model, positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.</p></details> | 36 pages, 14 figures |

Numerous prior studies have developed bespoke deep learning models over TCGA for tasks such as cancer survival prediction. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive feature embeddings agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we investigate the ability to train classical machine learning models over multimodal, zero-shot FM embeddings of cancer data. We demonstrate the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. Further, we show the benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we propose an embedding-centric approach to multimodal cancer modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>camer...</summary><p>camera ready version for ML4H 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Aligning Multimodal LLMs with Human Experts: A Focus on Parent-Child Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04366v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in human-centred AI systems, their ability to understand complex social interactions remains uncertain. We present an exploratory study on aligning MLLMs with speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in analysing joint attention in parent-child interactions, a key construct in early social-communicative development. Drawing on interviews and video annotations with three SLPs, we characterise how observational cues of gaze, action, and vocalisation inform their reasoning processes. We then test whether an MLLM can approximate this workflow through a two-stage prompting, separating observation from judgment. Our findings reveal that alignment is more robust at the observation layer, where experts share common descriptors, than at the judgement layer, where interpretive criteria diverge. We position this work as a case-based probe into expert-AI alignment in complex social behaviour, highlighting both the feasibility and the challenges of applying MLLMs to socially situated interaction analysis.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Test-Time Warmup for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10641v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder, and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up' before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlexAC: Towards Flexible Control of Associative Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11190v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation. Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC), a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors, whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks. Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ylhz/FlexAC.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 figures.

| **[Enhancing Multimodal Protein Function Prediction Through Dual-Branch Dynamic Selection with Reconstructive Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04040v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information, ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module (BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features. Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO, MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMHI: A Multimodal Egocentric Human Motion Dataset with HMD and Body-Worn IMUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17168v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric human pose estimation (HPE) using wearable sensors is essential for VR/AR applications. Most methods rely solely on either egocentric-view images or sparse Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) signals, leading to inaccuracies due to self-occlusion in images or the sparseness and drift of inertial sensors. Most importantly, the lack of real-world datasets containing both modalities is a major obstacle to progress in this field. To overcome the barrier, we propose EMHI, a multimodal \textbf{E}gocentric human \textbf{M}otion dataset with \textbf{H}ead-Mounted Display (HMD) and body-worn \textbf{I}MUs, with all data collected under the real VR product suite. Specifically, EMHI provides synchronized stereo images from downward-sloping cameras on the headset and IMU data from body-worn sensors, along with pose annotations in SMPL format. This dataset consists of 885 sequences captured by 58 subjects performing 39 actions, totaling about 28.5 hours of recording. We evaluate the annotations by comparing them with optical marker-based SMPL fitting results. To substantiate the reliability of our dataset, we introduce MEPoser, a new baseline method for multimodal egocentric HPE, which employs a multimodal fusion encoder, temporal feature encoder, and MLP-based regression heads. The experiments on EMHI show that MEPoser outperforms existing single-modal methods and demonstrates the value of our dataset in solving the problem of egocentric HPE. We believe the release of EMHI and the method could advance the research of egocentric HPE and expedite the practical implementation of this technology in VR/AR products.</p></details> |  |

To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated, multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10 public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting point for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be made publicly available to foster future research and applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

However, existing methods often suffer from structural inconsistencies, asset misalignment, and limited production readiness. This paper presents PSD2Code, a novel multi-modal approach that leverages PSD file parsing and asset alignment to generate production-ready React+SCSS code. Our method introduces a ParseAlignGenerate pipeline that extracts hierarchical structures, layer properties, and metadata from PSD files, providing large language models with precise spatial relationships and semantic groupings for frontend code generation. The system employs a constraint-based alignment strategy that ensures consistency between generated elements and design resources, while a structured prompt construction enhances controllability and code quality. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods across multiple metrics including code similarity, visual fidelity, and production readiness. The method exhibits strong model independence across different large language models, validating the effectiveness of integrating structured design information with multimodal large language models for industrial-grade code generation, marking an important step toward design-driven automated frontend development.</p></details> |  |

The system represents stories as graphs of nodes that can be expanded, edited, and iteratively refined through direct user edits and natural-language prompts. Each node can integrate text, images, audio, and video, allowing creators to compose multimodal narratives. A task selection agent routes between specialized generative tasks that handle story generation, node structure reasoning, node diagram formatting, and context generation. The interface supports targeted editing of individual nodes, automatic branching for parallel storylines, and node-based iterative refinement. Our results demonstrate that node-based editing supports control over narrative structure and iterative generation of text, images, audio, and video. We report quantitative outcomes on automatic story outline generation and qualitative observations of editing workflows. Finally, we discuss current limitations such as scalability to longer narratives and consistency across multiple nodes, and outline future work toward human-in-the-loop and user-centered creative AI tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025, Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, Workshop on Generative and Protective AI for Content Creation</p></details> |
| **[SnappyMeal: Design and Longitudinal Evaluation of a Multimodal AI Food Logging Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03907v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Food logging, both self-directed and prescribed, plays a critical role in uncovering correlations between diet, medical, fitness, and health outcomes. Through conversations with nutritional experts and individuals who practice dietary tracking, we find current logging methods, such as handwritten and app-based journaling, are inflexible and result in low adherence and potentially inaccurate nutritional summaries. These findings, corroborated by prior literature, emphasize the urgent need for improved food logging methods. In response, we propose SnappyMeal, an AI-powered dietary tracking system that leverages multimodal inputs to enable users to more flexibly log their food intake. SnappyMeal introduces goal-dependent follow-up questions to intelligently seek missing context from the user and information retrieval from user grocery receipts and nutritional databases to improve accuracy. We evaluate SnappyMeal through publicly available nutrition benchmarks and a multi-user, 3-week, in-the-wild deployment capturing over 500 logged food instances. Users strongly praised the multiple available input methods and reported a strong perceived accuracy. These insights suggest that multimodal AI systems can be leveraged to significantly improve dietary tracking flexibility and context-awareness, laying the groundwork for a new class of intelligent self-tracking applications.</p></details> | 24 pages, 15 figures |

| **[High-Precision Modal Analysis of Multimode Waveguides from Amplitudes via Large-Step Nonconvex Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12299v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing multimodal waveguide performance depends on modal analysis; however, existing methods focus predominantly on modal power distribution (MPD) and, limited by experimental hardware and conditions, exhibit low accuracy, poor adaptability, and high computational cost. This work presents a novel framework for comprehensive modal analysis (recovering both power and relative phase) using aperture field (AF) and far field (FF) amplitude measurements. We formulate the modal analysis as a nonconvex optimization problem under a power-normalization constraint and, inspired by recent advances in deep learning, introduce a large-step strategy to solve it. Our method retrieves both the MPD and the modal relative-phase distribution(MRPD). The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through visualization of the nonconvex optimization process via its loss landscape. Under noiseless conditions, analysis results of $93$ electromagnetic modes indicate that the relative amplitude accuracy $\mathrm{MRE_{Modulus}}$, and the phase accuracy $\mathrm{MAE_{Phase}}$, both reach the level of machine precision. Through noise simulations of the AF and environmental background, the operational principles of the method are demonstrated under signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions ranging from $10~\mathrm{dB}$ to $60~\mathrm{dB}$. Experiments further confirm that error suppression is effectively achieved by increasing the number of sampling points, thereby maintaining high accuracy and strong robustness. Within a unified evaluation framework, the absolute amplitude error $\mathrm{MAE_{Modulus}}$, and the phase error $\mathrm{MAE_{Phase}}$, are as low as $1.633\times10^{-8}$ and $0$, respectively. The accuracy is significantly superior to existing methods, while also exhibiting higher computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[What's in Common? Multimodal Models Hallucinate When Reasoning Across Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03768v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an open-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from hallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap between their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks that are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap, we build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With more than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training data to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by cognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking "what's in common?". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models specifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that perceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning across scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning models. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best performing model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex, consisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously, we find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present in the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen during training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide modest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs show bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer promise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the challenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures.

We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal understanding.

One proposed strategy is decomposition, which breaks down complex visualizations into structured components. In this work, we examine the efficacy of scalable vector graphics (SVGs) as a decomposition strategy for improving LMMs' performance on floor plans comprehension. Floor plans serve as a valuable testbed because they combine geometry, topology, and semantics, and their reliable comprehension has real-world applications, such as accessibility for blind and low-vision individuals. We conducted an exploratory study with three LMMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct) across 75 floor plans. Results show that combining SVG with raster input (SVG+PNG) improves performance on spatial understanding tasks but often hinders spatial reasoning, particularly in pathfinding. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of decomposition as a strategy for advancing spatial visualization comprehension.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Benchmarking the Thinking Mode of Multimodal Large Language Models in Clinical Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03328v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is the emergence of "reasoning MLLMs" that offer explicit control over their internal thinking processes (normally referred as the "thinking mode") alongside the standard "non-thinking mode". This capability allows these models to engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating a final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these "dual-state" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical tasks. This paper evaluates the active "thinking mode" capabilities of two leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced methods for medical knowledge integration.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes FUSAR-KLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into remote sensing research, constructing FUSAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT), providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships. (3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11 representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons against 14 leading foundation models, where FUSAR-KLIP demonstrates leading performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We expect that FUSAR-KLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.</p></details> |  |

Like professionals in the creative industries, this generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present ThinkSound, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages: foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes, interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce AudioCoT, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both audio metrics and CoT metrics, and excels in the out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio benchmark.

Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models become available.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 14 tables.

However, while various prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings, we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions (QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.</p></details> | 16 pages |

SmartWilds is a synchronized collection of drone imagery, camera trap photographs and videos, and bioacoustic recordings collected during summer 2025 at The Wilds safari park in Ohio. This dataset supports multimodal AI research for comprehensive environmental monitoring, addressing critical needs in endangered species research, conservation ecology, and habitat management.

While some machine learning methods have addressed specific challenges in this field, there is still a lack of foundation models designed for broad tasks like polymer property prediction using multimodal data. In this work, we present a multimodal polymer dataset to fine-tune VLMs through instruction-tuning pairs and assess the impact of multimodality on prediction performance. Our fine-tuned models, using LoRA, outperform unimodal and baseline approaches, demonstrating the benefits of multimodal learning. Additionally, this approach reduces the need to train separate models for different properties, lowering deployment and maintenance costs.</p></details> |  |

ProM3E is based on masked modality reconstruction in the embedding space, learning to infer missing modalities given a few context modalities. By design, our model supports modality inversion in the embedding space. The probabilistic nature of our model allows us to analyse the feasibility of fusing various modalities for given downstream tasks, essentially learning what to fuse. Using these features of our model, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval approach that mixes inter-modal and intra-modal similarities to achieve superior performance across all retrieval tasks. We further leverage the hidden representation from our model to perform linear probing tasks and demonstrate the superior representation learning capability of our model. All our code, datasets and model will be released at https://vishu26.github.io/prom3e.</p></details> | 21 pages, 16 figures |

In this paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations. More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing possible interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning (MAR) Workshop, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically, frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i) Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual representation.

Despite diverse application scenarios, systems are typically evaluated on traditional classification tasks, e.g., action recognition or temporal action segmentation. In this paper, we present a novel evaluation dataset, ProMQA, to measure system advancements in application-oriented scenarios. ProMQA consists of 401 multimodal procedural QA pairs on user recording of procedural activities, i.e., cooking, coupled with their corresponding instructions/recipes. For QA annotation, we take a cost-effective human-LLM collaborative approach, where the existing annotation is augmented with LLM-generated QA pairs that are later verified by humans. We then provide the benchmark results to set the baseline performance on ProMQA. Our experiment reveals a significant gap between human performance and that of current systems, including competitive proprietary multimodal models.

To address data scarcity, we introduce SuperRS-VQA (avg. 8,376$\times$8,376) and HighRS-VQA (avg. 2,000$\times$1,912), the highest-resolution vision-language datasets in RS to date, covering 22 real-world dialogue tasks. To mitigate token explosion, our pilot studies reveal significant redundancy in RS images: crucial information is concentrated in a small subset of object-centric tokens, while pruning background tokens (e.g., ocean or forest) can even improve performance. Motivated by these findings, we propose two strategies: Background Token Pruning and Anchored Token Selection, to reduce the memory footprint while preserving key semantics.Integrating these techniques, we introduce GeoLLaVA-8K, the first RS-focused multimodal large language model capable of handling inputs up to 8K$\times$8K resolution, built on the LLaVA framework.

A Visual Token Compression Benchmark for Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02650v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging, have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets, covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs (LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on efficient multimodal modeling.</p></details> |  |

While recent high performance models and high quality datasets have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities. Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories, eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks (WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively, surpassing all previous methods.

A Multimodal Benchmark for Verifying Truthfulness in Multi-Party Social Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27195v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding, makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> | ICCV2025 Workshop |

We posit that text and image thoughts should function as complementary rather than isomorphic modalities that mutually advance reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model fine-tuned on approximately 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks (averaging 34.7 percent over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks, matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance, ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts. These findings suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of unified models for multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://thinkmorph.github.io/</p></details> |

These limitations: \textit{narrow-source heterogeneity (single/few data sources), constrained scientific granularity, and limited-sphere extensibility}. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{OmniEarth-Bench}, the first multimodal benchmark that systematically spans all six spheres: atmosphere, lithosphere, oceanosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and human-activity sphere, and cross-spheres. Built with a scalable, modular-topology data inference framework and native multi-observation sources and expert-in-the-loop curation, OmniEarth-Bench produces 29,855 standardized, expert-curated annotations. All annotations are organized into a four-level hierarchy (Sphere, Scenario, Ability, Task), encompassing 109 expert-curated evaluation tasks. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach 35\% accuracy, revealing systematic gaps in Earth-system cognitive ability.

While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements, when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Relaxed Multimodal Inputs for Gait-based Parkinson's Disease Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15748v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years, particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques. Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources. However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

Radar sensors are a promising sensing modality because of their fast capture rates and their independence from lighting conditions. To achieve high spatial resolution, MIMO radars with large apertures are required. Yet, they are infrequently used for dynamic scenarios due to significant limitations in signal processing algorithms. These limitations impose substantial hardware constraints due to their computational intensity and reliance on large signal bandwidths, ultimately restricting the sensor's capture rate. One solution of previous work is to use few frequencies only, which enables faster capture and requires less computation; however, this requires coarse knowledge of the target's position and works in a limited depth range only. To address these challenges, we extend previous work into the multimodal domain with MM-2FSK, which leverages an assistive optical depth sensing modality to obtain a depth prior, enabling high framerate capture with only few frequencies. We evaluate our method using various target objects with known ground truth geometry that is spatially registered to real millimeter-wave MIMO radar measurements. Our method demonstrates superior performance in terms of depth quality, being able to compete with the time- and resource-intensive measurements with many frequencies.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, as modern AI agents transition from static knowledge bases to continuous multimodal streams encompassing text, images, video, and audio, two critical challenges arise: maintaining index freshness without prohibitive re-indexing costs, and preserving cross-modal semantic consistency across heterogeneous embedding spaces. We present LUMA-RAG, a lifelong multimodal agent architecture featuring three key innovations: (i) a streaming, multi-tier memory system that dynamically spills embeddings from a hot HNSW tier to a compressed IVFPQ tier under strict memory budgets; (ii) a streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge that maintains cross-modal consistency through incremental orthogonal Procrustes updates; and (iii) stability-aware retrieval telemetry providing Safe@k guarantees by jointly bounding alignment drift and quantization error. Experiments demonstrate robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94), graceful performance degradation under product quantization offloading, and provably stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0), establishing LUMA-RAG as a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

Current studies have proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding, showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation. Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others. Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MMGenSR Workshop (CIKM 2025)</p></details> |

In response, we leverage the strong transfer and generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance. Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary counterparts.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel, efficient, and lightweight approach for robot action prediction, offering significantly reduced computational cost and inference latency compared to conventional video prediction models. Importantly, it pioneers the adaptation of the InstructPix2Pix model for forecasting future visual frames in robotic tasks, extending its utility beyond static image editing. We implement a deep learning-based visual prediction framework that forecasts what a robot will observe 100 frames (10 seconds) into the future, given a current image and a textual instruction. We repurpose and fine-tune the InstructPix2Pix model to accept both visual and textual inputs, enabling multimodal future frame prediction. Experiments on the RoboTWin dataset (generated based on real-world scenarios) demonstrate that our method achieves superior SSIM and PSNR compared to state-of-the-art baselines in robot action prediction tasks. Unlike conventional video prediction models that require multiple input frames, heavy computation, and slow inference latency, our approach only needs a single image and a text prompt as input. This lightweight design enables faster inference, reduced GPU demands, and flexible multimodal control, particularly valuable for applications like robotics and sports motion trajectory analytics, where motion trajectory precision is prioritized over visual fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages including appendix, 4 tables, 8 figures, to be submitted to WACV 2026</p></details> |

We propose OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context. A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines. Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, challenges remain in applying these models to 3D spatial interactions and managing data collection costs. To address these issues, we propose the multimodal robotic manipulation model RoboTron-Mani and the comprehensive dataset RoboData. RoboTron-Mani, on one hand, enhances 3D perception through camera parameters and occupancy supervision. On the other hand, it further incorporates Modality-Isolation-Mask and multimodal decoder blocks based on OpenFlamingo, improving modality fusion and fine-grained perception. RoboData integrats several publicly-available datasets, achieving the first fusion of multi-view images, camera parameters, depth maps, actions, and space alignment, which facilitates comprehensive learning from diverse robotic datasets and offers one complete evaluation system. Trained on RoboData, RoboTron-Mani is the first generalist policy that surpasses expert models, enabling simultaneous evaluation of all tasks across multiple datasets, rather than being limited to specific data or task selections. Specifically, RoboTron-Mani boosts manipulation performance by increasing the average sequence length on CALVIN from 1.7 to 3.5, enabling cross-embodiment generalization, and achieving state-of-the-art results on both simulated and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this capability, our proposed approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video Reasoning \& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.</p></details> | <details><summary>1st p...</summary><p>1st place winner of Grounded Videoqa track at the ICCV2025 Perception Test</p></details> |

Astronomical spectra exemplify this challenge: massive surveys have collected millions of spectra across a wide range of wavelengths and resolutions, yet analyses remain fragmented across spectral domains (e.g., optical vs. infrared) and object types (e.g., stars vs. galaxies), limiting the ability to pool information across datasets. We present a deep learning model that jointly learns from heterogeneous spectra in a self-supervised manner. Our universal spectral tokenizer processes spectra from a variety of object types and resolutions directly on their native wavelength grids, producing intrinsically aligned, homogeneous, and physically meaningful representations that can be efficiently adapted to achieve competitive performance across a range of downstream tasks. For the first time, we demonstrate that a single model can unify spectral data across resolutions and domains, suggesting that our model can serve as a powerful building block for foundation models in astronomy -- and potentially extend to other scientific domains with heterogeneous sequential data, such as climate and healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop; v2: added collaboration</p></details> |

However, existing RSSI-based positioning methods often suffer from reduced accuracy due to environmental complexity and challenges in processing multi-source information. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-graph heterogeneous GNN framework (MG-HGNN) to enhance spatial awareness and improve positioning performance. In this framework, two graph construction branches perform node and edge embedding, respectively, to generate informative graphs. Subsequently, a heterogeneous graph neural network is employed for graph representation learning, enabling accurate positioning. The MG-HGNN framework introduces the following key innovations: 1) multi-type task-directed graph construction that combines label estimation and feature encoding for richer graph information; 2) a heterogeneous GNN structure that enhances the performance of conventional GNN models. Evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc public datasets demonstrate that MG-HGNN not only achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods, but also provides a novel perspective for enhancing GNN-based localization methods. Ablation studies further confirm the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Despite this progress, current LLM-based approaches typically address each task independently, training separate models that raise computational and deployment resource use while missing potential cross-task synergies. They also rely on fixed-rate token compression, which restricts flexibility in balancing accuracy with efficiency. These limitations highlight the need for a unified framework that can support ASR, VSR, and AVSR while enabling elastic inference. To this end, we present Omni-AVSR, a unified audio-visual LLM that combines efficient multi-granularity training with parameter-efficient adaptation. Specifically, we adapt the matryoshka representation learning paradigm to efficiently train across multiple audio and visual granularities, reducing its inherent training resource use. Furthermore, we explore three LoRA-based strategies for adapting the backbone LLM, balancing shared and task-specific specialization. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 show that Omni-AVSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art baselines while training a single model at substantially lower training and deployment resource use. The model also remains robust under acoustic noise, and we analyze its scaling behavior as LLM size increases, providing insights into the trade-off between performance and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://umbertocappellazzo.github.io/Omni-AVSR/</p></details> |

Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our UrbanLN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper by AAAI-26</p></details> |

Despite recent advances, deepfake detection models often struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions, particularly when applied to media content found in the wild. In this work, we present a robust video deepfake detection framework with strong generalization that takes advantage of the rich facial representations learned by face foundation models. Our method is built on top of FSFM, a self-supervised model trained on real face data, and is further fine-tuned using an ensemble of deepfake datasets spanning both face-swapping and face-reenactment manipulations. To enhance discriminative power, we incorporate triplet loss variants during training, guiding the model to produce more separable embeddings between real and fake samples. Additionally, we explore attribution-based supervision schemes, where deepfakes are categorized by manipulation type or source dataset, to assess their impact on generalization. Extensive experiments across diverse evaluation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, especially in challenging real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The authors did not manage to secure approval by the funder of this research on time</p></details> |

Existing deep learning methods, from early regression models to recent contrastive learning approaches, primarily rely on structural data while overlooking protein sequences, which are more accessible and can enhance generalizability. However, directly integrating protein sequences poses challenges due to the redundancy and noise in large-scale protein-ligand datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{S$^2$Drug}, a two-stage framework that explicitly incorporates protein \textbf{S}equence information and 3D \textbf{S}tructure context in protein-ligand contrastive representation learning. In the first stage, we perform protein sequence pretraining on ChemBL using an ESM2-based backbone, combined with a tailored data sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and noise on both protein and ligand sides. In the second stage, we fine-tune on PDBBind by fusing sequence and structure information through a residue-level gating module, while introducing an auxiliary binding site prediction task. This auxiliary task guides the model to accurately localize binding residues within the protein sequence and capture their 3D spatial arrangement, thereby refining protein-ligand matching. Across multiple benchmarks, S$^2$Drug consistently improves virtual screening performance and achieves strong results on binding site prediction, demonstrating the value of bridging sequence and structure in contrastive learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 Main Technical Track</p></details> |

Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer backbones have recently shown strong potential for histopathology representation learning. However, conventional random patch sampling during MAE pretraining often includes irrelevant or noisy regions, limiting the model's ability to capture meaningful tissue patterns. In this paper, we present a lightweight and domain-adapted framework that brings structure and biological relevance into MAE-based learning through a wavelet-informed patch selection strategy. WISE-MAE applies a two-step coarse-to-fine process: wavelet-based screening at low magnification to locate structurally rich regions, followed by high-resolution extraction for detailed modeling. This approach mirrors the diagnostic workflow of pathologists and improves the quality of learned representations. Evaluations across multiple cancer datasets, including lung, renal, and colorectal tissues, show that WISE-MAE achieves competitive representation quality and downstream classification performance while maintaining efficiency under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |

Yet, while self-supervised speech representation learning from raw waveforms has been remarkably successful, these approaches have not achieved similar feats for general-purpose audio representation learning from waveforms. Here, we propose WavJEPA, a waveform-based version of the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture. WavJEPA leverages high-level semantic representation learning to tackle the shortcomings of representation learning at the speech unit or token level. We show that this approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art time-domain audio foundation models across a wide variety of downstream benchmark tasks, while requiring considerably fewer computational resources. Additionally, to overcome the performance drop that time-domain models typically exhibit in noisy and reverberant real-world acoustic environments, we present WavJEPA-Nat. WavJEPA-Nat is a multi-channel extension of the WavJEPA architecture trained on simulated naturalistic scenes. We find that WavJEPA-Nat is highly robust to reverberation and noise. These results highlight the feasibility and computational efficiency of general-purpose audio representation learning from raw waveforms, showcasing the potential for low-latency, robust time-domain audio foundation models for real-world applications.</p></details> | Still under review |

Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last available observations. This transforms unobserved timestamps into noise-aware training targets, enabling meaningful reconstruction signals. A Wasserstein metric aligns reconstruction error distributions between observed and pseudo-observed regions, while a contrastive learning objective enhances the discriminability of learned representations. Extensive experiments on classification, interpolation, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that iTimER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the ISTS setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

While existing solutions, such as residual connections and skip layers, alleviate this issue to some extent, they fail to explicitly model how node representations evolve in a node-specific and progressive manner across layers. Moreover, these methods do not take global information into account, which is also crucial for mitigating the over-smoothing problem. To address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a Dual Mamba-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (DMbaGCN), which is a novel framework that integrates Mamba into GNNs to address over-smoothing from both local and global perspectives. DMbaGCN consists of two modules: the Local State-Evolution Mamba (LSEMba) for local neighborhood aggregation and utilizing Mamba's selective state space modeling to capture node-specific representation dynamics across layers, and the Global Context-Aware Mamba (GCAMba) that leverages Mamba's global attention capabilities to incorporate global context for each node. By combining these components, DMbaGCN enhances node discriminability in deep GNNs, thereby mitigating over-smoothing. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, most existing methods compress images into 2-D latent spaces via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Swin Transformers, which tend to retain substantial spatial redundancy, thereby limiting overall compression performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed RWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture that encodes images into more compact 1-D latent representations by synergistically integrating the complementary strengths of linear-attention-based RWKV and self-attention-based Transformer models. Specifically, MRT partitions each image into fixed-size windows, utilizing RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows and Transformer blocks to model local redundancies within each window. The hierarchical attention mechanism enables more efficient and compact representation learning in the 1-D domain. To further enhance compression efficiency, we introduce a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) tailored to the structure characteristics of the intermediate 1-D latent features in MRT. Extensive experiments on standard image compression benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed MRT framework consistently achieves superior reconstruction quality at bitrates below 0.02 bits per pixel (bpp). Quantitative results based on the DISTS metric show that MRT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art 2-D architecture GLC, achieving bitrate savings of 43.75%, 30.59% on the Kodak and CLIC2020 test datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

A particularly intriguing phenomenon in these models is the emergence of unimodal representation dynamics, where the quality of learned features peaks at an intermediate noise level. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical and empirical investigation of this phenomenon. Leveraging the inherent low-dimensionality structure of image data, we theoretically demonstrate that the unimodal dynamic emerges when the diffusion model successfully captures the underlying data distribution. The unimodality arises from an interplay between denoising strength and class confidence across noise scales. Empirically, we further show that, in classification tasks, the presence of unimodal dynamics reliably reflects the generalization of the diffusion model: it emerges when the model generates novel images and gradually transitions to a monotonically decreasing curve as the model begins to memorize the training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

| **[FreqGRL: Suppressing Low-Frequency Bias and Mining High-Frequency Knowledge for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06648v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain few-shot learning (CD-FSL) aims to recognize novel classes with only a few labeled examples under significant domain shifts. While recent approaches leverage a limited amount of labeled target-domain data to improve performance, the severe imbalance between abundant source data and scarce target data remains a critical challenge for effective representation learning. We present the first frequency-space perspective to analyze this issue and identify two key challenges: (1) models are easily biased toward source-specific knowledge encoded in the low-frequency components of source data, and (2) the sparsity of target data hinders the learning of high-frequency, domain-generalizable features. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{FreqGRL}, a novel CD-FSL framework that mitigates the impact of data imbalance in the frequency space. Specifically, we introduce a Low-Frequency Replacement (LFR) module that substitutes the low-frequency components of source tasks with those from the target domain to create new source tasks that better align with target characteristics, thus reducing source-specific biases and promoting generalizable representation learning. We further design a High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) module that filters out low-frequency components and performs learning directly on high-frequency features in the frequency space to improve cross-domain generalization. Additionally, a Global Frequency Filter (GFF) is incorporated to suppress noisy or irrelevant frequencies and emphasize informative ones, mitigating overfitting risks under limited target supervision. Extensive experiments on five standard CD-FSL benchmarks demonstrate that our frequency-guided framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaberNet: Causal Representation Learning for Cross-Domain HVAC Energy Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06634v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain HVAC energy prediction is essential for scalable building energy management, particularly because collecting extensive labeled data for every new building is both costly and impractical. Yet, this task remains highly challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction. In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge, CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions, minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence. We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving a 22.9\% reduction in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to the best benchmark. Our code is available at https://github.com/rickzky1001/CaberNet-CRL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM e-Energy 2026</p></details> |

Recent advanced methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to characterize the spatial structure of road segments in a self-supervised paradigm. However, spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of road networks raise severe challenges to the neighborhood smoothing mechanism of self-supervised GNNs. To address these issues, we propose a $\textbf{D}$ual-branch $\textbf{S}$patial-$\textbf{T}$emporal self-supervised representation framework for enhanced road representations, termed as DST. On one hand, DST designs a mix-hop transition matrix for graph convolution to incorporate dynamic relations of roads from trajectories. Besides, DST contrasts road representations of the vanilla road network against that of the hypergraph in a spatial self-supervised way. The hypergraph is newly built based on three types of hyperedges to capture long-range relations. On the other hand, DST performs next token prediction as the temporal self-supervised task on the sequences of traffic dynamics based on a causal Transformer, which is further regularized by differentiating traffic modes of weekdays from those of weekends. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods verify the superiority of our proposed framework. Moreover, the comprehensive spatiotemporal modeling facilitates DST to excel in zero-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper, we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture. UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity. The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric design.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures.

Mitigating Over-Squashing of GNNs via Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06443v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing graph neural networks typically rely on heuristic choices for hidden dimensions and propagation depths, which often lead to severe information loss during propagation, known as over-squashing. To address this issue, we propose Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation (C3E), a novel framework that formulates the selection of hidden dimensions and depth as a nonlinear programming problem grounded in information theory. Through modeling spectral graph neural networks as communication channels, our approach directly connects channel capacity to hidden dimensions, propagation depth, propagation mechanism, and graph structure. Extensive experiments on nine public datasets demonstrate that hidden dimensions and depths estimated by C3E can mitigate over-squashing and consistently improve representation learning. Experimental results show that over-squashing occurs due to the cumulative compression of information in representation matrices. Furthermore, our findings show that increasing hidden dimensions indeed mitigate information compression, while the role of propagation depth is more nuanced, uncovering a fundamental balance between information compression and representation complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 11 figures.

| **[Non-Negative Stiefel Approximating Flow: Orthogonalish Matrix Optimization for Interpretable Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06425v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretable representation learning is a central challenge in modern machine learning, particularly in high-dimensional settings such as neuroimaging, genomics, and text analysis. Current methods often struggle to balance the competing demands of interpretability and model flexibility, limiting their effectiveness in extracting meaningful insights from complex data. We introduce Non-negative Stiefel Approximating Flow (NSA-Flow), a general-purpose matrix estimation framework that unifies ideas from sparse matrix factorization, orthogonalization, and constrained manifold learning. NSA-Flow enforces structured sparsity through a continuous balance between reconstruction fidelity and column-wise decorrelation, parameterized by a single tunable weight. The method operates as a smooth flow near the Stiefel manifold with proximal updates for non-negativity and adaptive gradient control, yielding representations that are simultaneously sparse, stable, and interpretable. Unlike classical regularization schemes, NSA-Flow provides an intuitive geometric mechanism for manipulating sparsity at the level of global structure while simplifying latent features. We demonstrate that the NSA-Flow objective can be optimized smoothly and integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines for dimensionality reduction while improving interpretability and generalization in both simulated and real biomedical data. Empirical validation on the Golub leukemia dataset and in Alzheimer's disease demonstrate that the NSA-Flow constraints can maintain or improve performance over related methods with little additional methodological effort. NSA-Flow offers a scalable, general-purpose tool for interpretable ML, applicable across data science domains.</p></details> |  |

Existing retrieval methods, such as traditional mass spectral library matching, suffer from limited spectral library coverage, while recent cross-modal representation learning frameworks often encounter modality misalignment, resulting in suboptimal retrieval accuracy and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GLMR, a Generative Language Model-based Retrieval framework that mitigates the cross-modal misalignment through a two-stage process. In the pre-retrieval stage, a contrastive learning-based model identifies top candidate molecules as contextual priors for the input mass spectrum. In the generative retrieval stage, these candidate molecules are integrated with the input mass spectrum to guide a generative model in producing refined molecular structures, which are then used to re-rank the candidates based on molecular similarity. Experiments on both MassSpecGym and the proposed MassRET-20k dataset demonstrate that GLMR significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 40% improvement in top-1 accuracy and exhibiting strong generalizability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Although discriminative models have achieved notable success in this domain, the full potential of generative models remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CoD$^2$}, a novel framework that combines the data distribution modeling capabilities of diffusion models with the semantic representation learning strengths of discriminative models to extract robust gait features. We propose a Multi-level Conditional Control strategy that incorporates both high-level identity-aware semantic conditions and low-level visual details. Specifically, the high-level condition, extracted by the discriminative extractor, guides the generation of identity-consistent gait sequences, whereas low-level visual details, such as appearance and motion, are preserved to enhance consistency. Furthermore, the generated sequences facilitate the discriminative extractor's learning, enabling it to capture more comprehensive high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on four datasets (SUSTech1K, CCPG, GREW, and Gait3D) demonstrate that CoD$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be seamlessly integrated with existing discriminative methods, yielding consistent improvements.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4figures |

However, many approaches miss post-fix latent vulnerabilities that remain even after patches typically due to incomplete fixes or overlooked issues may later lead to zero-day exploits. In this paper, we propose $HYDRA$, a $Hy$brid heuristic-guided $D$eep $R$epresentation $A$rchitecture for predicting latent zero-day vulnerabilities in patched functions that combines rule-based heuristics with deep representation learning to detect latent risky code patterns that may persist after patches. It integrates static vulnerability rules, GraphCodeBERT embeddings, and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to uncover anomalies often missed by symbolic or neural models alone. We evaluate HYDRA in an unsupervised setting on patched functions from three diverse real-world software projects: Chrome, Android, and ImageMagick. Our results show HYDRA predicts 13.7%, 20.6%, and 24% of functions from Chrome, Android, and ImageMagick respectively as containing latent risks, including both heuristic matches and cases without heuristic matches ($None$) that may lead to zero-day vulnerabilities. It outperforms baseline models that rely solely on regex-derived features or their combination with embeddings, uncovering truly risky code variants that largely align with known heuristic patterns. These results demonstrate HYDRA's capability to surface hidden, previously undetected risks, advancing software security validation and supporting proactive zero-day vulnerabilities discovery.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we first introduce the X2Edit Dataset, a comprehensive dataset covering 14 diverse editing tasks, including subject-driven generation. We utilize the industry-leading unified image generation models and expert models to construct the data. Meanwhile, we design reasonable editing instructions with the VLM and implement various scoring mechanisms to filter the data. As a result, we construct 3.7 million high-quality data with balanced categories. Second, to better integrate seamlessly with community image generation models, we design task-aware MoE-LoRA training based on FLUX.1, with only 8\% of the parameters of the full model. To further improve the final performance, we utilize the internal representations of the diffusion model and define positive/negative samples based on image editing types to introduce contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model's editing performance is competitive among many excellent models. Additionally, the constructed dataset exhibits substantial advantages over existing open-source datasets.

Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks.

We present the Rotary Masked Autoencoder (RoMAE), which utilizes the popular Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) method for continuous positions. RoMAE is an extension to the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that enables interpolation and representation learning with multidimensional continuous positional information while avoiding any time-series-specific architectural specializations. We showcase RoMAE's performance on a variety of modalities including irregular and multivariate time-series, images, and audio, demonstrating that RoMAE surpasses specialized time-series architectures on difficult datasets such as the DESC ELAsTiCC Challenge while maintaining MAE's usual performance across other modalities. In addition, we investigate RoMAE's ability to reconstruct the embedded continuous positions, demonstrating that including learned embeddings in the input sequence breaks RoPE's relative position property.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

While recent vision-language representation learning methods have shown promise, their potential in UDA segmentation tasks remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose TCSA-UDA, a Text-driven Cross-Semantic Alignment framework that leverages domain-invariant textual class descriptions to guide visual representation learning. Our approach introduces a vision-language covariance cosine loss to directly align image encoder features with inter-class textual semantic relations, encouraging semantically meaningful and modality-invariant feature representations. Additionally, we incorporate a prototype alignment module that aligns class-wise pixel-level feature distributions across domains using high-level semantic prototypes. This mitigates residual category-level discrepancies and enhances cross-modal consistency. Extensive experiments on challenging cross-modality cardiac, abdominal, and brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our TCSA-UDA framework significantly reduces domain shift and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods, establishing a new paradigm for integrating language-driven semantics into domain-adaptive medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advanced Hybrid Transformer LSTM Technique with Attention and TS Mixer for Drilling Rate of Penetration Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05210v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rate of Penetration (ROP) prediction is critical for drilling optimization yet remains challenging due to the nonlinear, dynamic, and heterogeneous characteristics of drilling data. Conventional empirical, physics-based, and standard machine learning models rely on oversimplified assumptions or intensive feature engineering, constraining their capacity to model long-term dependencies and intricate feature interactions. To address these issues, this study presents a new deep learning Hybrid LSTM-Trans-Mixer-Att framework that first processes input data through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling cycles. Subsequently, an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization refines the features. Concurrently, a parallel Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block introduced facilitates efficient cross-feature interaction modeling of static and categorical parameters, including lithological indices and mud properties. The feature representations extracted from the Enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer modules are integrated through a dedicated fusion layer. Finally, an adaptive attention mechanism then dynamically assigns contextual weights to salient features, enhancing discriminative representation learning and enabling high-fidelity ROP prediction. The proposed framework combines sequential memory, static feature interactions, global context learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution for the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics. Experimental validation on real-world drilling datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving an Rsquare of 0.9991 and a MAPE of 1.447%, significantly outperforming existing baseline and hybrid models.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 Pa...</summary><p>31 Pages, 16 Figures, 9 Tables</p></details> |
| **[ADPretrain: Advancing Industrial Anomaly Detection via Anomaly Representation Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05245v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift. The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies), we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously. To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features.

To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology, and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a 1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks miss. When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and +0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FinAI@CIKM 2025</p></details> |

This complexity poses a significant challenge to understanding their internal learning mechanisms. In this work, we propose a novel analytical framework that recasts a multi-layer ReLU network into an equivalent single-layer linear model with input-dependent "effective weights". For any given input sample, the activation pattern of ReLU units creates a unique computational path, effectively zeroing out a subset of weights in the network. By composing the active weights across all layers, we can derive an effective weight matrix, $W_{\text{eff}}(x)$, that maps the input directly to the output for that specific sample. We posit that the evolution of these effective weights reveals fundamental principles of representation learning. Our work demonstrates that as training progresses, the effective weights corresponding to samples from the same class converge, while those from different classes diverge. By tracking the trajectories of these sample-wise effective weights, we provide a new lens through which to interpret the formation of class-specific decision boundaries and the emergence of semantic representations within the network.</p></details> |  |

Learning robust representation in presence of error slices is challenging, especially in self-supervised settings during the feature reconstruction phase, due to high cardinality features and the complexity of constructing error sets. Traditional robust representation learning methods are largely focused on improving worst group performance in supervised setting in computer vision, leaving a gap in approaches tailored for tabular data. We address this gap by developing a framework to learn robust representation in tabular data during self-supervised pre-training. Our approach utilizes an encoder-decoder model trained with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) loss to learn robust latent representations. This paper applies the Just Train Twice (JTT) and Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) methods during the pre-training phase for tabular data. These methods fine-tune the ERM pre-trained model by up-weighting error-prone samples or creating balanced datasets for specific categorical features. This results in specialized models for each feature, which are then used in an ensemble approach to enhance downstream classification performance. This methodology improves robustness across slices, thus enhancing overall generalization performance. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

Current deep learning methods, despite their effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA (Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction). Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection systems without compromising accuracy.

Representation learning has become a key driver of deep learning applications, as it allows learning latent spaces that capture important properties of the data without requiring any supervised annotations. Although representation learning has been hugely successful in predictive tasks, it can fail miserably in causal tasks including predicting the effect of a perturbation/intervention. This calls for a marriage between representation learning and causal inference. An exciting opportunity in this regard stems from the growing availability of multi-modal data (observational and perturbational, imaging-based and sequencing-based, at the single-cell level, tissue-level, and organism-level). We outline a statistical and computational framework for causal structure and representation learning motivated by fundamental biomedical questions: how to effectively use observational and perturbational data to perform causal discovery on observed causal variables; how to use multi-modal views of the system to learn causal variables; and how to design optimal perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has successfully completed peer review and will appear in the Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians 2026.

To address these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning (DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning. Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Graph Neural Networks for Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02531v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explanations Go Linear: Interpretable and Individual Latent Encoding for Post-hoc Explainability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20667v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-hoc explainability is essential for understanding black-box machine learning models. Surrogate-based techniques are widely used for local and global model-agnostic explanations but have significant limitations. Local surrogates capture non-linearities but are computationally expensive and sensitive to parameters, while global surrogates are more efficient but struggle with complex local behaviors. In this paper, we present ILLUME, a flexible and interpretable framework grounded in representation learning, that can be integrated with various surrogate models to provide explanations for any black-box classifier. Specifically, our approach combines a globally trained surrogate with instance-specific linear transformations learned with a meta-encoder to generate both local and global explanations. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ILLUME in producing feature attributions and decision rules that are not only accurate but also robust and faithful to the black-box, thus providing a unified explanation framework that effectively addresses the limitations of traditional surrogate methods.</p></details> | ICDM 2025 |
| **[HiMaCon: Discovering Hierarchical Manipulation Concepts from Unlabeled Multi-Modal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11321v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective generalization in robotic manipulation requires representations that capture invariant patterns of interaction across environments and tasks. We present a self-supervised framework for learning hierarchical manipulation concepts that encode these invariant patterns through cross-modal sensory correlations and multi-level temporal abstractions without requiring human annotation. Our approach combines a cross-modal correlation network that identifies persistent patterns across sensory modalities with a multi-horizon predictor that organizes representations hierarchically across temporal scales. Manipulation concepts learned through this dual structure enable policies to focus on transferable relational patterns while maintaining awareness of both immediate actions and longer-term goals. Empirical evaluation across simulated benchmarks and real-world deployments demonstrates significant performance improvements with our concept-enhanced policies. Analysis reveals that the learned concepts resemble human-interpretable manipulation primitives despite receiving no semantic supervision. This work advances both the understanding of representation learning for manipulation and provides a practical approach to enhancing robotic performance in complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

We propose a two-stage training framework combining contrastive learning and conditional decoding to enable flexible style control. The first stage aligns code style representations with semantic and structural features. In the second stage, we fine-tune a language model (e.g., Flan-T5) conditioned on the learned style vector to guide generation. Our method supports style interpolation and user personalization via lightweight mixing. Compared to prior work, our unified framework offers improved stylistic control without sacrificing code correctness. This is among the first approaches to combine contrastive alignment with conditional decoding for style-guided code generation.</p></details> |  |

Departing from conventional autoencoder and neural network pipelines, the proposed method leverages the MedGemma foundation model, incorporating a SigLIP-derived vision encoder pretrained on diverse medical imaging modalities. Preprocessed X-ray images are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using the MedGemma vision backbone, which are subsequently passed through a lightweight multilayer perceptron for binary classification. Experimental assessment reveals that the MedGemma-driven classifier exhibits strong performance, exceeding conventional convolutional and autoencoder-based metrics. Additionally, the model leverages MedGemma's transfer learning capabilities, enhancing generalization and optimizing feature engineering. The integration of a modern medical foundation model not only enhances representation learning but also facilitates modular training strategies such as selective encoder block unfreezing for efficient domain adaptation. The findings suggest that MedGemma-powered classification systems can advance clinical radiograph triage by providing scalable and accurate abnormality detection, with potential for broader applications in automated medical image analysis.

| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v5)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 34 pages |

In our work, we propose a discrete variational autoencoder (VAE) based model where the ground truth information about the generative factors are not provided to the model. We demonstrate the advantages of learning discrete representations over learning continuous representations in facilitating disentanglement. Furthermore, we propose incorporating an inductive bias into the model to further enhance disentanglement. Precisely, we propose scalar quantization of the latent variables in a latent representation with scalar values from a global codebook, and we add a total correlation term to the optimization as an inductive bias. Our method called FactorQVAE combines optimization based disentanglement approaches with discrete representation learning, and it outperforms the former disentanglement methods in terms of two disentanglement metrics (DCI and InfoMEC) while improving the reconstruction performance. Our code can be found at https://github.com/ituvisionlab/FactorQVAE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurocomputing</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate a family of closely related information-theoretic objectives, including information funnels and bottlenecks, designed to extract invariant representations from data. We introduce the Conditional Privacy Funnel with Side-information (CPFSI), a novel formulation within this family, applicable in both fully and semi-supervised settings. Given the intractability of these objectives, we derive neural-network-based approximations via amortized variational inference. We systematically analyze the trade-offs between utility, invariance, and representation fidelity, offering new insights into the Pareto frontiers of these methods. Our results demonstrate that CPFSI effectively balances these competing objectives and frequently outperforms existing approaches. Furthermore, we show that by intervening on sensitive attributes in CPFSI's predictive posterior enhances fairness while maintaining predictive performance. Finally, we focus on the real-world applicability of these approaches, particularly for learning robust and fair representations from tabular datasets in data scarce-environments -- a modality where these methods are often especially relevant.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Machine Learning (Springer), vol. 114, no. 12, Article 267, 2025</p></details> |
| **[How does training shape the Riemannian geometry of neural network representations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11375v4)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In machine learning, there is a long history of trying to build neural networks that can learn from fewer example data by baking in strong geometric priors. However, it is not always clear a priori what geometric constraints are appropriate for a given task. Here, we explore the possibility that one can uncover useful geometric inductive biases by studying how training molds the Riemannian geometry induced by unconstrained neural network feature maps. We first show that at infinite width, neural networks with random parameters induce highly symmetric metrics on input space. This symmetry is broken by feature learning: networks trained to perform classification tasks learn to magnify local areas along decision boundaries. This holds in deep networks trained on high-dimensional image classification tasks, and even in self-supervised representation learning. These results begin to elucidate how training shapes the geometry induced by unconstrained neural network feature maps, laying the groundwork for an understanding of this richly nonlinear form of feature learning.</p></details> | 92 pages, 48 figures |

To overcome this tradeoff, we introduce POEMS: Product Of Experts for Interpretable Multiomics Integration using Sparse Decoding, an unsupervised probabilistic framework that preserves predictive performance while providing interpretability. POEMS provides interpretability without linearizing any part of the network by 1) mapping features to latent factors using sparse connections, which directly translates to biomarker discovery, 2) allowing for cross-omic associations through a shared latent space using product of experts model, and 3) reporting contributions of each omic by a gating network that adaptively computes their influence in the representation learning. Additionally, we present an efficient sparse decoder. In a cancer subtyping case study, POEMS achieves competitive clustering and classification performance while offering our novel set of interpretations, demonstrating that biomarker based insight and predictive accuracy can coexist in multiomics representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sundial: A Family of Highly Capable Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00816v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Sundial, a family of native, flexible, and scalable time series foundation models. To predict the next-patch's distribution, we propose a TimeFlow Loss based on flow-matching, which facilitates native pre-training of Transformers on continuous-valued time series without discrete tokenization. Conditioned on arbitrary-length time series, our models are pre-trained without specifying any prior distribution and can generate multiple probable predictions, achieving more flexibility in representation learning than using parametric densities. Towards time series foundation models, we leverage minimal but crucial adaptations of Transformers and curate TimeBench with one trillion time points, comprising mostly real-world datasets and synthetic data. By mitigating mode collapse via TimeFlow Loss, we pre-train a family of Sundial models on TimeBench, which achieve unprecedented model capacity and generalization performance. In addition to excellent scalability, Sundial achieves state-of-the-art results on both point and probabilistic forecasting benchmarks with a just-in-time inference speed, i.e., making zero-shot predictions within a few milliseconds. We believe that Sundial's pioneering generative forecasting capability can improve model reliability in real-world decision-making.

| **[Depth-induced NTK: Bridging Over-parameterized Neural Networks and Deep Neural Kernels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05585v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, its theoretical understanding of representation learning remains limited. Deep neural kernels provide a principled framework to interpret over-parameterized neural networks by mapping hierarchical feature transformations into kernel spaces, thereby combining the expressive power of deep architectures with the analytical tractability of kernel methods. Recent advances, particularly neural tangent kernels (NTKs) derived by gradient inner products, have established connections between infinitely wide neural networks and nonparametric Bayesian inference. However, the existing NTK paradigm has been predominantly confined to the infinite-width regime, while overlooking the representational role of network depth. To address this gap, we propose a depth-induced NTK kernel based on a shortcut-related architecture, which converges to a Gaussian process as the network depth approaches infinity. We theoretically analyze the training invariance and spectrum properties of the proposed kernel, which stabilizes the kernel dynamics and mitigates degeneration. Experimental results further underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our findings significantly extend the existing landscape of the neural kernel theory and provide an in-depth understanding of deep learning and the scaling law.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring the Intrinsic Dimension of Earth Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02101v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation, geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact, learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability, regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training. Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts, facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print. 27 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Foundational Theory of Quantitative Abstraction: Adjunctions, Duality, and Logic for Probabilistic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19444v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analysis and control of stochastic dynamical systems rely on probabilistic models such as (continuous-space) Markov decision processes, but large or continuous state spaces make exact analysis intractable and call for principled quantitative abstraction. This work develops a unified theory of such abstraction by integrating category theory, coalgebra, quantitative logic, and optimal transport, centred on a canonical $\varepsilon$-quotient of the behavioral pseudo-metric with a universal property: among all abstractions that collapse behavioral differences below $\varepsilon$, it is the most detailed, and every other abstraction achieving the same discounted value-loss guarantee factors uniquely through it. Categorically, a quotient functor $Q_\varepsilon$ from a category of probabilistic systems to a category of metric specifications admits, via the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem, a right adjoint $R_\varepsilon$, yielding an adjunction $Q_\varepsilon \dashv R_\varepsilon$ that formalizes a duality between abstraction and realization; logically, a quantitative modal $\mu$-calculus with separate reward and transition modalities is shown, for a broad class of systems, to be expressively complete for the behavioral pseudo-metric, with a countable fully abstract fragment suitable for computation. The theory is developed coalgebraically over Polish spaces and the Giry monad and validated on finite-state models using optimal-transport solvers, with experiments corroborating the predicted contraction properties and structural stability and aligning with the theoretical value-loss bounds, thereby providing a rigorous foundation for quantitative state abstraction and representation learning in probabilistic domains.</p></details> |  |

ProM3E is based on masked modality reconstruction in the embedding space, learning to infer missing modalities given a few context modalities. By design, our model supports modality inversion in the embedding space. The probabilistic nature of our model allows us to analyse the feasibility of fusing various modalities for given downstream tasks, essentially learning what to fuse. Using these features of our model, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval approach that mixes inter-modal and intra-modal similarities to achieve superior performance across all retrieval tasks. We further leverage the hidden representation from our model to perform linear probing tasks and demonstrate the superior representation learning capability of our model.

| **[XR-1: Towards Versatile Vision-Language-Action Models via Learning Unified Vision-Motion Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02776v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large-scale robotic datasets and vision-language models (VLMs) has advanced research on vision-language-action (VLA) models. However, existing VLA models still face two fundamental challenges: (i) producing precise low-level actions from high-dimensional observations, (ii) bridging domain gaps across heterogeneous data sources, including diverse robot embodiments and human demonstrations. Existing methods often encode latent variables from either visual dynamics or robotic actions to guide policy learning, but they fail to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal knowledge present in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. In this work, we present X Robotic Model 1 (XR-1), a novel framework for versatile and scalable VLA learning across diverse robots, tasks, and environments. XR-1 introduces the \emph{Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC)}, a discrete latent representation learned via a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and robotic motion. UVMC addresses these challenges by (i) serving as an intermediate representation between the observations and actions, and (ii) aligning multimodal dynamic information from heterogeneous data sources to capture complementary knowledge. To effectively exploit UVMC, we propose a three-stage training paradigm: (i) self-supervised UVMC learning, (ii) UVMC-guided pretraining on large-scale cross-embodiment robotic datasets, and (iii) task-specific post-training. We validate XR-1 through extensive real-world experiments with more than 14,000 rollouts on six different robot embodiments, spanning over 120 diverse manipulation tasks. XR-1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as $\pi_{0.5}$, $\pi_0$, RDT, UniVLA, and GR00T-N1.5 while demonstrating strong generalization to novel objects, background variations, distractors, and illumination changes.

In this work, we revisit the Ising model, a well-established member of the Markov Random Field (MRF) family, and develop a distributed framework that enables scalable and privacy-preserving representation learning from large-scale binary data with inherent low-rank structure. Our approach optimizes a non-convex surrogate loss function via bi-factored gradient descent, offering substantial computational and communication advantages over conventional convex approaches. We evaluate our algorithm on multi-institutional electronic health record (EHR) datasets from 58,248 patients across the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and Mass General Brigham (MGB), demonstrating superior performance in global representation learning and downstream clinical tasks, including relationship detection, patient phenotyping, and patient clustering. These results highlight a broader potential for statistical inference in federated, high-dimensional settings while addressing the practical challenges of data complexity and multi-institutional integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modality-Transition Representation Learning for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02685v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements, when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[SKGE: Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding with Geometric Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02460v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for representation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as TransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent limitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training. In this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model that challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a compact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear Spherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate that SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean counterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237 and CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We provide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing that this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to comprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally, we prove that the spherical geometry creates an "inherently hard negative sampling" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the model to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our findings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for geometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful and stable KGE models.</p></details> |  |

While most existing methods rely on contrastive learning, we explore an alternative approach by framing place recognition as a multi-class classification problem.

We evaluate this approach on the NuScenes dataset and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to contrastive learning-based methods while offering advantages in training efficiency and stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniCoD: Enhancing Robot Policy via Unified Continuous and Discrete Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10642v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building generalist robot policies that can handle diverse tasks in open-ended environments is a central challenge in robotics. To leverage knowledge from large-scale pretraining, prior work (VLA) has typically built generalist policies either on top of vision-language understanding models (VLMs) or generative models. However, both semantic understanding from vision-language pretraining and visual dynamics modeling from visual-generation pretraining are crucial for embodied robots. Recent unified models of generation and understanding have demonstrated strong capabilities in both comprehension and generation through large-scale pretraining. We posit that robotic policy learning can likewise benefit from the combined strengths of understanding, planning, and continuous future representation learning. Building on this insight, we introduce UniCoD, which acquires the ability to dynamically model high-dimensional visual features through pretraining on over 1M internet-scale instructional manipulation videos. Subsequently, UniCoD is fine-tuned on data collected from the robot embodiment, enabling the learning of mappings from predictive representations to action tokens. Extensive experiments show our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of 9\% and 12\% across simulation environments and real-world out-of-distribution tasks.</p></details> |  |

While the segmentation of camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation. However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2025), 8 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Latent Zoning Network: A Unified Principle for Generative Modeling, Representation Learning, and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15591v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10.

| **[Bridging Lifelong and Multi-Task Representation Learning via Algorithm and Complexity Measure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01847v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In lifelong learning, a learner faces a sequence of tasks with shared structure and aims to identify and leverage it to accelerate learning. We study the setting where such structure is captured by a common representation of data. Unlike multi-task learning or learning-to-learn, where tasks are available upfront to learn the representation, lifelong learning requires the learner to make use of its existing knowledge while continually gathering partial information in an online fashion. In this paper, we consider a generalized framework of lifelong representation learning. We propose a simple algorithm that uses multi-task empirical risk minimization as a subroutine and establish a sample complexity bound based on a new notion we introduce--the task-eluder dimension. Our result applies to a wide range of learning problems involving general function classes. As concrete examples, we instantiate our result on classification and regression tasks under noise.</p></details> |  |

Despite the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into MVC, their input graph structures remain susceptible to noise interference. Methods based on Multi-view Graph Refinement (MGRC) also have limitations such as insufficient consideration of cross-view consistency, difficulty in handling hard-to-distinguish samples in the feature space, and disjointed optimization processes caused by graph construction algorithms. To address these issues, a Multi-View Clustering method via a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network (MCFCN) is proposed. The network learns the consensus graph of multi-view data in an end-to-end manner and learns effective consensus representations through a view feature fusion model and a Unified Graph Structure Adapter (UGA). It designs Similarity Matrix Alignment Loss (SMAL) and Feature Representation Alignment Loss (FRAL). With the guidance of consensus, it optimizes view-specific graphs, preserves cross-view topological consistency, promotes the construction of intra-class edges, and realizes effective consensus representation learning with the help of GCN to improve clustering performance. MCFCN demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on eight multi-view benchmark datasets, and its effectiveness is verified by extensive qualitative and quantitative implementations.

However, existing training pipelines are often inflexible, domain-specific, or computationally expensive, which limits their usability across different domains and resource settings. DINO-MX is a modular and extensible training framework that combines the core principles of DINO, DINOv2 and DINOv3 within a unified configuration-driven system. It supports a variety of transformer-based architectures and is fully compatible with the Hugging Face ecosystem. The framework includes multiple training strategies such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), layer freezing, and knowledge distillation, along with support for distributed training through both Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) and Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP). DINO-MX is designed to work with both natural and specialized data types, including single- and multi-channel images. Experimental results on diverse datasets show that DINO-MX achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational costs. Additionally, it offers interpretability tools and a label-guided data augmentation method that improves attention-based localization without the need for extra detection or segmentation heads. DINO-MX provides a reproducible and scalable foundation for developing, adapting, and benchmarking self-supervised vision models across a range of research and real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

While Deep Modularity Networks (DMoN) leverage modularity maximization and collapse regularization to ensure structural separation, they lack explicit mechanisms for feature-space separation, assignment dispersion, and assignment-confidence control. We address this limitation by proposing Deep Modularity Networks with Diversity-Preserving Regularization (DMoN-DPR), which introduces three novel regularization terms: distance-based for inter-cluster separation, variance-based for per-cluster assignment dispersion, and an assignment-entropy penalty with a small positive weight, encouraging more confident assignments gradually. Our method significantly enhances label-based clustering metrics on feature-rich benchmark datasets (paired two-tailed t-test, $p\leq0.05$), demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating diversity-preserving regularizations in creating meaningful and interpretable clusters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: New Perspectives in Graph Machine Learning (NPGML)</p></details> |

This visual-to-neural mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability.

Model-free Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms struggle with the joint challenge of representation learning, partial observability, and credit assignment. To address this, we propose a novel framework based on a shared, generative Multimodal World Model (MWM). Our MWM is trained to learn a compressed latent representation of the environment's dynamics by fusing distributed, multimodal observations from all agents using a scalable attention-based mechanism. Subsequently, we leverage this learned MWM as a fast, "imagined" simulator to train cooperative MARL policies (e.g., MAPPO) entirely within its latent space, decoupling representation learning from policy learning. We introduce a new set of challenging multimodal, multi-agent benchmarks built on a 3D physics simulator. Our experiments demonstrate that our MWM-MARL framework achieves orders-of-magnitude greater sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art model-free MARL baselines. We further show that our proposed multimodal fusion is essential for task success in environments with sensory asymmetry and that our architecture provides superior robustness to sensor-dropout, a critical feature for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Focused Video Group Activities Hashing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00490v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH (multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence-aware Causal Autoencoder Network for Node Importance Ranking in Complex Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01228v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node importance ranking is a fundamental problem in graph data analysis. Existing approaches typically rely on node features derived from either traditional centrality measures or advanced graph representation learning methods, which depend directly on the target network's topology. However, this reliance on structural information raises privacy concerns and often leads to poor generalization across different networks. In this work, we address a key question: Can we design a node importance ranking model trained exclusively on synthetic networks that is effectively appliable to real-world networks, eliminating the need to rely on the topology of target networks and improving both practicality and generalizability? We answer this question affirmatively by proposing the Influence-aware Causal Autoencoder Network (ICAN), a novel framework that leverages causal representation learning to get robust, invariant node embeddings for cross-network ranking tasks. Firstly, ICAN introduces an influence-aware causal representation learning module within an autoencoder architecture to extract node embeddings that are causally related to node importance. Moreover, we introduce a causal ranking loss and design a unified optimization framework that jointly optimizes the reconstruction and ranking objectives, enabling mutual reinforcement between node representation learning and ranking optimization. This design allows ICAN, trained on synthetic networks, to generalize effectively across diverse real-world graphs. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ICAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both ranking accuracy and generalization capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generalized Bisimulation Metric of State Similarity between Markov Decision Processes: From Theoretical Propositions to Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18714v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Anatomically Constrained Transformers for Echocardiogram Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01109v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video transformers have recently demonstrated strong potential for echocardiogram (echo) analysis, leveraging self-supervised pre-training and flexible adaptation across diverse tasks. However, like other models operating on videos, they are prone to learning spurious correlations from non-diagnostic regions such as image backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Video Anatomically Constrained Transformer (ViACT), a novel framework that integrates anatomical priors directly into the transformer architecture. ViACT represents a deforming anatomical structure as a point set and encodes both its spatial geometry and corresponding image patches into transformer tokens. During pre-training, ViACT follows a masked autoencoding strategy that masks and reconstructs only anatomical patches, enforcing that representation learning is focused on the anatomical region. The pre-trained model can then be fine-tuned for tasks localized to this region. In this work we focus on the myocardium, demonstrating the framework on echo analysis tasks such as left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) regression and cardiac amyloidosis (CA) detection. The anatomical constraint focuses transformer attention within the myocardium, yielding interpretable attention maps aligned with regions of known CA pathology. Moreover, ViACT generalizes to myocardium point tracking without requiring task-specific components such as correlation volumes used in specialized tracking networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Geometry of Grokking: Norm Minimization on the Zero-Loss Manifold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01938v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grokking is a puzzling phenomenon in neural networks where full generalization occurs only after a substantial delay following the complete memorization of the training data. Previous research has linked this delayed generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods often utilize attention mechanisms or graph convolutional networks to model visual representations, their performance is still constrained by two critical limitations: the inability to learn discriminative semantic-aware features, and the lack of fine-grained alignment between visual representations and label embeddings. To tackle these issues in a unified framework, this paper proposes a novel approach named Semantic-aware representation learning via Conditional Transport for Multi-Label Image Classification (SCT). The proposed method introduces a semantic-related feature learning module that extracts discriminative label-specific features by emphasizing semantic relevance and interaction, along with a conditional transport-based alignment mechanism that enables precise visual-semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on two widely-used benchmark datasets, VOC2007 and MS-COCO, validate the effectiveness of SCT and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |

However, existing methods for multimodal document retrieval often replicate techniques developed for text-only retrieval, whether in how they encode documents, define training objectives, or compute similarity scores. To address these limitations, we present ColMate, a document retrieval model that bridges the gap between multimodal representation learning and document retrieval. ColMate utilizes a novel OCR-based pretraining objective, a self-supervised masked contrastive learning objective, and a late interaction scoring mechanism more relevant to multimodal document structures and visual characteristics. ColMate obtains 3.61% improvements over existing retrieval models on the ViDoRe V2 benchmark, demonstrating stronger generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Despite promising developments in the evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support, unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning. Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.5% in the Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.1% AUC gain.</p></details> | Technical Report |

These limitations restrict their expressiveness, personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets, nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Repetition-Invariant Representations for Polymer Informatics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10726v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polymers are large macromolecules composed of repeating structural units known as monomers and are widely applied in fields such as energy storage, construction, medicine, and aerospace. However, existing graph neural network methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, the existing diffusion-based paradigm often struggles to capture strong temporal dependencies across multiple steps, particularly when incorporating proprioceptive input. This limitation can lead to task failures, where the policy overfits to proprioceptive cues at the expense of capturing the visually derived features of the task. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Deep Koopman-boosted Dual-branch Diffusion Policy (D3P) algorithm. D3P introduces a dual-branch architecture to decouple the roles of different sensory modality combinations. The visual branch encodes the visual observations to indicate task progression, while the fused branch integrates both visual and proprioceptive inputs for precise manipulation. Within this architecture, when the robot fails to accomplish intermediate goals, such as grasping a drawer handle, the policy can dynamically switch to execute action chunks generated by the visual branch, allowing recovery to previously observed states and facilitating retrial of the task. To further enhance visual representation learning, we incorporate a Deep Koopman Operator module that captures structured temporal dynamics from visual inputs. During inference, we use the test-time loss of the generative model as a confidence signal to guide the aggregation of the temporally overlapping predicted action chunks, thereby enhancing the reliability of policy execution. In simulation experiments across six RLBench tabletop tasks, D3P outperforms the state-of-the-art diffusion policy by an average of 14.6\%. On three real-world robotic manipulation tasks, it achieves a 15.0\% improvement.

FedMGP equips each client with multiple groups of paired textual and visual prompts, enabling the model to capture diverse, fine-grained semantic and instance-level cues. A diversity loss is introduced to drive each prompt group to specialize in distinct and complementary semantic aspects, ensuring that the groups collectively cover a broader range of local characteristics. During communication, FedMGP employs a dynamic prompt aggregation strategy based on similarity-guided probabilistic sampling: each client computes the cosine similarity between its prompt groups and the global prompts from the previous round, then samples s groups via a softmax-weighted distribution. This soft selection mechanism preferentially aggregates semantically aligned knowledge while still enabling exploration of underrepresented patterns effectively balancing the preservation of common knowledge with client-specific features. Notably, FedMGP maintains parameter efficiency by redistributing a fixed prompt capacity across multiple groups, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest communication parameters among all federated prompt learning methods. Theoretical analysis shows that our dynamic aggregation strategy promotes robust global representation learning by reinforcing shared semantics while suppressing client-specific noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedMGP consistently outperforms prior approaches in both personalization and domain generalization across diverse federated vision-language benchmarks. The code will be released on https://github.com/weihao-bo/FedMGP.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying the Roles of LLM Layers in Retrieval, Knowledge, and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02091v3)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs) contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation, pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers -- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 |

Many such foundation models adopt approaches that have demonstrated success in computer vision with minimal domain-specific modification. However, the development and application of foundation models in this field are still burgeoning, as there are a variety of competing approaches for how to most effectively leverage remotely sensed data. This paper examines these approaches, along with their roots in the computer vision field. This is done to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls, while outlining future directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the need for massive compute resources. We first examine single-sensor remote foundation models to introduce concepts and provide context, and then place emphasis on incorporating the multi-sensor aspect of Earth observations into foundation models. In particular, we explore the extent to which existing approaches leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote sensing observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, submitted to ACM SigSpatial, currently under peer review.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been one of the most impactful techniques in modeling high-dimensional latent variables in this context. However, the limited expressiveness of the inference model based on traditional VAEs can still hinder the estimation performance. We introduce Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB) algorithms as an improvement to VAEs for IFA with improved flexibility and accuracy. By bridging the strengths of VAEs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), AVB incorporates an auxiliary discriminator network to reframe the estimation process as a two-player adversarial game and removes the restrictive assumption of standard normal distributions in the inference model. Theoretically, AVB can achieve similar or higher likelihood compared to VAEs. A further enhanced algorithm, Importance-weighted Adversarial Variational Bayes (IWAVB) is proposed and compared with Importance-weighted Autoencoders (IWAE). In an exploratory analysis of empirical data, IWAVB demonstrated superior expressiveness by achieving a higher likelihood compared to IWAE. In confirmatory analysis with simulated data, IWAVB achieved similar mean-square error results to IWAE while consistently achieving higher likelihoods. When latent variables followed a multimodal distribution, IWAVB outperformed IWAE. With its innovative use of GANs, IWAVB is shown to have the potential to extend IFA to handle large-scale data, facilitating the potential integration of psychometrics and multimodal data analysis.</p></details> |  |

At their core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw. The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small, imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision. Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

This issue is especially pronounced in low-resource settings, where data scarcity and limited domain diversity hinder robust generalization. Domain generalization (DG) approaches address this challenge by learning features that remain invariant across domains, often using causal mechanisms to improve model robustness. In this study, we examine two distinct causal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks. First, we investigate a causal data augmentation (CDA) approach that automatically generates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious correlations. We apply this method to sentiment classification on the NaijaSenti Twitter corpus, expanding the training data with semantically equivalent paraphrases to simulate controlled distribution shifts. Second, we explore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the DINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment analysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting. Our findings demonstrate that both approaches enhance robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data augmentation yields consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment classification, while causal representation learning with DINER improves out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, albeit with varying gains across languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Byzantine Resilient Federated Multi-Task Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19209v3)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose BR-MTRL, a Byzantine-resilient multi-task representation learning framework that handles faulty or malicious agents. Our approach leverages representation learning through a shared neural network model, where all clients share fixed layers, except for a client-specific final layer. This structure captures shared features among clients while enabling individual adaptation, making it a promising approach for leveraging client data and computational power in heterogeneous federated settings to learn personalized models. To learn the model, we employ an alternating gradient descent strategy: each client optimizes its local model, updates its final layer, and sends estimates of the shared representation to a central server for aggregation. To defend against Byzantine agents, we employ two robust aggregation methods for client-server communication, Geometric Median and Krum. Our method enables personalized learning while maintaining resilience in distributed settings. We implemented the proposed algorithm in a federated testbed built using Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform and compared its performance with various benchmark algorithms and their variations. Through experiments using real-world datasets, including CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST, we demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our approach and its transferability to new unseen clients with limited data, even in the presence of Byzantine adversaries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Neural Graph Sparsification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27474v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are central to modeling complex systems in domains such as social networks, molecular chemistry, and neuroscience. While Graph Neural Networks, particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network, a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation. The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and clear advantages of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Model-Aware Counterfactual Explanations for Random Forest](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27397v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their enormous predictive power, machine learning models are often unsuitable for applications in regulated industries such as finance, due to their limited capacity to provide explanations. While model-agnostic frameworks such as Shapley values have proved to be convenient and popular, they rarely align with the kinds of causal explanations that are typically sought after. Counterfactual case-based explanations, where an individual is informed of which circumstances would need to be different to cause a change in outcome, may be more intuitive and actionable. However, finding appropriate counterfactual cases is an open challenge, as is interpreting which features are most critical for the change in outcome. Here, we pose the question of counterfactual search and interpretation in terms of similarity learning, exploiting the representation learned by the random forest predictive model itself. Once a counterfactual is found, the feature importance of the explanation is computed as a function of which random forest partitions are crossed in order to reach it from the original instance. We demonstrate this method on both the MNIST hand-drawn digit dataset and the German credit dataset, finding that it generates explanations that are sparser and more useful than Shapley values.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at XAI-FIN-2025: International Joint Workshop on Explainable AI in Finance: Achieving Trustworthy Financial Decision-Making; November 15, 2025; Singapore</p></details> |
| **[Soft Task-Aware Routing of Experts for Equivariant Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27222v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings. Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Functional embeddings enable Aggregation of multi-area SEEG recordings over subjects and sessions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27090v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging since electrode count, placement, and covered regions vary widely. Spatial normalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference, but often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when localization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted brain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between individuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i) learns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from multi-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive objectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to region-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a transformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of channels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal ganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording sessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear, region-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The transformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or supervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of masked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding. Together, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject aggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task structure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Incremental Human-Object Interaction Detection with Invariant Relation Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27020v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models. Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs.

| **[CARE: Contrastive Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16988v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation) fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clone Deterministic 3D Worlds with Geometrically-Regularized World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26782v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves. Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment. GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks, GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniTok-Audio: A Unified Audio Generation Framework via Generative Modeling on Discrete Codec Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26372v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling has recently achieved remarkable success across text, image, and audio domains, demonstrating powerful capabilities for unified representation learning. However, audio generation models still face challenges in terms of audio quality and generalization ability across tasks. This fragmentation results in redundant development efforts, inconsistent performance, and limited extensibility. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{UniTok-Audio}, a scalable and extensible framework for unified audio generation tasks. Specifically, 1) UniTok-Audio extracts continuous feature of conditions to generates discrete tokens of target audio in an autoregressive manner; 2) a special task identifier token unifies different learning patterns of multiple tasks in a single framework; 3) a dual-stream audio codec involving acoustic and semantic branch is developed for high-fidelity waveform reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that UniTok-Audio achieves competitive performance in comparation with state-of-the-art task-specific or multi-task systems across five time-aligned tasks: speech restoration, target speaker extraction, speech separation, voice conversion, and language-queried audio source separation. To foster future research, we will open-source our codebase. The demo page of our work can be found here: https://alibaba.github.io/unified-audio.</p></details> | 21 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Understanding Hardness of Vision-Language Compositionality from A Token-level Causal Lens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26302v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential, language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text, proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially, token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReaKase-8B: Legal Case Retrieval via Knowledge and Reasoning Representations with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26178v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legal case retrieval (LCR) is a cornerstone of real-world legal decision making, as it enables practitioners to identify precedents for a given query case. Existing approaches mainly rely on traditional lexical models and pretrained language models to encode the texts of legal cases. Yet there are rich information in the relations among different legal entities as well as the crucial reasoning process that uncovers how legal facts and legal issues can lead to judicial decisions. Such relational reasoning process reflects the distinctive characteristics of each case that can distinguish one from another, mirroring the real-world judicial process. Naturally, incorporating such information into the precise case embedding could further enhance the accuracy of case retrieval. In this paper, a novel ReaKase-8B framework is proposed to leverage extracted legal facts, legal issues, legal relation triplets and legal reasoning for effective legal case retrieval. ReaKase-8B designs an in-context legal case representation learning paradigm with a fine-tuned large language model. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and COLIEE 2023 demonstrate that our knowledge and reasoning augmented embeddings substantially improve retrieval performance over baseline models, highlighting the potential of integrating legal reasoning into legal case retrieval systems. The code has been released on https://github.com/yanran-tang/ReaKase-8B.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the Gap Between Molecule and Textual Descriptions via Substructure-aware Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26157v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information. However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks, highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text learning.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 (main) |
| **[Decoupled Multimodal Fusion for User Interest Modeling in Click-Through Rate Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11066v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern industrial recommendation systems improve recommendation performance by integrating multimodal representations from pre-trained models into ID-based Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction frameworks. However, existing approaches typically adopt modality-centric modeling strategies that process ID-based and multimodal embeddings independently, failing to capture fine-grained interactions between content semantics and behavioral signals. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Multimodal Fusion (DMF), which introduces a modality-enriched modeling strategy to enable fine-grained interactions between ID-based collaborative representations and multimodal representations for user interest modeling. Specifically, we construct target-aware features to bridge the semantic gap across different embedding spaces and leverage them as side information to enhance the effectiveness of user interest modeling. Furthermore, we design an inference-optimized attention mechanism that decouples the computation of target-aware features and ID-based embeddings before the attention layer, thereby alleviating the computational bottleneck introduced by incorporating target-aware features. To achieve comprehensive multimodal integration, DMF combines user interest representations learned under the modality-centric and modality-enriched modeling strategies. Offline experiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DMF. Moreover, DMF has been deployed on the product recommendation system of the international e-commerce platform Lazada, achieving relative improvements of 5.30% in CTCVR and 7.43% in GMV with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
